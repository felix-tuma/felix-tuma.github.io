       "['FJH AG: Initial assessment of the 2003 annual result Shortly after the discontinuation of the investigations carried out by the Department of Public Prosecutions, the Executive Board of the consulting and software company FJH AG, listed in the TecDAX (ISIN DE0005130108), has provided an initial, preliminary assessment of the 2003 financial year. Following the first three successful quarters, the fourth quarter was characterised by special factors so that, on the whole, the annual net income is expected to amount to just under 8 million Euro. The anonymous charge against responsible parties at FJH in October 2003 as well as various press articles published in this connection led to an apparent restraint in regard to the placement of new, or the extension of existing, orders. The discontinuation of the investigations just before Christmas had no effect on the fourth quarter any more. Around half of the loss of sales anticipated for the fourth quarter can be attributed to this fact. In addition, the insurance customers of FJH also faced considerable uncertainty in the fourth quarter as to the fiscal treatment of life assurances - the fiscal treatment of the companies as much as the tax privileges of different types of insurance. Therefore, the caution over longer-term investments described in the 9-month report continued unabated. Finally, the company saw a stabilisation in two difficult projects and thus a lasting safeguarding of long-term customer relations. The Executive Board is confident that, in the course of 2004, the company will return to its usual earnings strength. Appropriate measures for an increase in sales and a cost reduction have already been taken.

This corresponds to year- on-year growth in new business of 11 percent for the full year 2003. The volume of new business came to EUR 90m in Q4 2003, representing a rise of 20 percent over Q3 (EUR 75m) (previous year: 14 percent). The margin of new business (contribution margin 1), from which the financial result over the life of a contract is derived and which is thus a key profitability indicator, grew correspondingly to EUR 33.9m in 2003, as compared to a figure of EUR 28.5m in the previous year. This represents a 19 percent increase. Its new business in Germany rose in 2003 by 16 percent. GRENKELEASING's foreign subsidiaries showed the effect of what was - compared to the previous year - a more restrictive acceptance policy. They made a 22 percent contribution to the group's new business. The company will publish its annual accounts for 2003 on March 2, 2004. The Executive Board\",\n",

The board of TELES AG just agreed on continuing buying back, for the purpose of restructuring the community of TELES investors in order to increased the engagement of institutional investors, as announced earlier already, on the stock exchange and in the coming weeks, own shares for up to 2 MioEuro - i.e. presumably about 170.000 pieces or 1.5 percent of its free float. The basis of this repurchase is, on the one side, the continuing very high position of free cash at hand with TELES and, on the other side, the empowerment of its board for doing so resolved upon by its General Assembly on 22.08.2003, which prescribes that the purchase price per share must not exceed more than 10 percent resp. fall below by more than 20 % of the average share price during the last 3 trading days.

       " 'Annual Financial Results 2002/2003 (30.09.2003) --Sales revenues increase to EUR 18.7m --Strong Q4 with positive EBIT Vienna, 8 January 2003 : Sanochemia Pharmazeutika AG (SAC), a Vienna-based Prime Segment listing, announces sales revenues for the 2002/03 financial year of EUR 18.7m : up on the previous period (EUR 18.3). This is also higher than the forecast EUR 17.5m made at the beginning of the financial year, which reflected difficulty in securing contract synthesis orders in H1. Due to higher R&D spendings and in line with expectations, EBIT were negative at EUR -5.3m (EUR - 1.6m), although a positive operating result in Q4 was a clear sign of improvement. The financial result rose to EUR 2.5m (EUR 2.2m). The result after taxes was EUR -1.3m (EUR 0.7m), with EPS of EUR -0.11 (EUR 0.06 in 2001/02). The revenue forecast of EUR 5.0m (based on conservative projections of demand for synthetic galantamine) for the SYNTHESIS segment (galantamine and contract synthesis) made at the opening of the year was exceeded. Revenues for the period were EUR 7.7m (EUR 7.4m). A large order for galantamine in Q4 and well-filled order books for other APIs fed through to segment EBIT of EUR 3.9m. The year-on- year drop of 23% in EBIT (from EUR 5.5m) was due to intensified marketing activities (to make up for a shortfall in synthesis orders). Despite a shutdown of the production facility for refitting work, the HUMAN PHARMACEUTICALS division was still able to maintain sales revenues at the level of the previous year (up EUR 0.1m to EUR 11.0m). The improvement in EBIT to EUR -1.7m (EUR -1.9m) was achieved in spite of high start-up costs for the newly founded Swiss subsidiary. No revenues were reported by the R&D division. Scheduled research costs of EUR 3.8m (EUR 2.1m) advanced three projects significantly closer to the market such that several registrations applications and royalty payments can be expected in the coming FY. The excellent Q4 results are worth highlighting. In comparison with the same quarter a year earlier, sales revenues rose 66% to EUR 7.6m while EBIT reached EUR 1.2m. OUTLOOK: Based on a growth spurt in core business, sales revenues of EUR 24.0m would appear realistic while break even has been as the target for the bottom line. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 08.01.2004',\n",

Ahead of the commercial aviation market upturn expected in 2005, EADS targets around 20 percent EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes, pre-goodwill amortization and exceptionals) growth in 2004 over the 2003 guidance. The EADS CEOs Philippe Camus and Rainer Hertrich said: \"The airline industry is slowly recovering and is still under pressure. We have assigned ourselves realistic targets for 2004, consistent with our practice of financial dependability. These targets are a first milestone on the road to double digit EBIT margins in the medium-term, and they support a solid financial position.\" \"Diligence is imperative.\" the CEOs continued. \"We have reviewed the current Space restructuring plan, and it is fully on track; we have also audited our Airbus order book and are continuing to carefully manage the growth of our defence business.\" EADS also confirms its full-year 2003 targets. For 2004, EADS targets generally stable revenues of around Euro 29 - 30 billion, for the fourth straight year in this general downturn of the industry. Defence business growth is expected to offset the decline of Airbus revenues attributable to the combination of the US currency weakness and slightly lower deliveries. The 2004 revenues target is based on the assumption of a weaker US Dollar than in 2003 (1Euro = US Dollar 1.20, compared to 1Euro = US Dollar 1.10) for the computation of the portion of revenues that is naturally hedged by US Dollar denominated purchasing (amounting to about one third of overall EADS revenues). Following a careful assessment of its order book, Airbus targets close to 300 aircraft deliveries in 2004. A conservative management of delivery slots gives EADS flexibility to face unexpected events and to apply customer financing restraint. The slight decline of Airbus deliveries and the continuing A380 R&D effort will hamper 2004 EBIT. The recovery of the Space Division is the main source of increased profitability. The dramatic restructuring plan currently under implementation and a number of organizational improvements are the main drivers of the expected swing to breakeven EBIT of this Division in 2004. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 08.01.2004',\n",

Nokia Networks sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 were significantly higher than estimated and reached approximately EUR 1.7 billion (versus the previous guidance of EUR 1.4 billion).

However, on a constant currency basis, fourth quarter software revenues were up by 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2002.

Total revenues for the fourth quarter are expected to be approximately EUR2.2 billion, which is down 3% from the EUR2.3 billion reported in the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter total revenues were up by 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2002.

Calculated with retrospective effect without the SMS Group, which left the MAN Group as of 1 October 2003 following its sale to the Weiss family as co-shareholder, MAN recorded new orders of EUR13.7 billion (unchanged against 2002) and sales of EUR13.5 billion (-2%). Orders on hand amounted to EUR7.3 billion (-2%) at the end of 2003. In December, very good levels of incoming orders were registered by commercial vehicles, printing systems, diesel engines and turbomachinery, with the result that in some cases these labour-intensive sectors were able to close the year with significant increases. SMS was included in the accounts up to 30 September 2003. The relevant 2003 figures for the MAN Group including SMS showed new orders of EUR14.8 billion and sales of EUR15.0 billion. At 31 December 2003, the MAN Group numbered 64,218 employees, which on a comparable basis represented 1,958 or 3% fewer than at 31 December 2002.

This positive picture emerged from the provisional figures for 2003 released today by the company. During the past year, the global sales of the Girindus corporate group rose to about 32 million Euros as compared to 27.6 million Euros in 2002. The company thus achieved a two-digit percentage increase in sales for the third year in a row. During 2003 the company was able to boost productivity by optimizing numerous internal processes. The sales per employee amounted to about 250,000 Euros, for example, and was thus about 30 percent above the 2002 level. On the basis of the project portfolio, which contains highly promising drug candidates in the late clinical phases II and III, Girindus faces a bright future. The company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) also experienced a noticeable rise to minus 400,000 Euros from their 2002 value of minus 1.0 million Euros. Only the weak USD prevented the company from achieving positive EBITDA in 2003. Sales continued to gather steam during the last three months of 2003. Sales of 14 million Euros recorded for this three-month period alone resulted in an unmistakably positive figure for earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for this quarter. With this result the company overshot all the targets it had set at the beginning of its 2003 fiscal year. The company will present the final year-end figures for fiscal 2003 and the outlook for the future at the accounts press conference schedule to be held in Düsseldorf on March 25, 2004. Peter J.

Zapf Creation AG, Europe's leading brand manufacturer of play, functional and mini dolls including accessories, today announced that it met its revised sales guidance for fiscal year 2003 according to preliminary, unaudited figures. Consolidated sales amounted to approximately EUR 201 million, which, as expected, was some 10 percent below the previous year's figure of EUR 222.7 million. Adjusted for currency translation effects, consolidated sales were approximately EUR 214 million, just 4 percent below previous year's sales. Approximately EUR 17.4 million of the decline in sales was due to the American market. Of this figure, EUR 7 million were the result of currency translation effects. Germany recorded a sales decline of just under EUR 3.5 million. This development is exclusively due to the mini doll segment, which did not perform as planned. This means that the German core business comprising the branded play concepts BABY born (R), Baby Annabell and CHOU CHOU recorded a sales growth of approximately one percent compared to fiscal year 2002. Sales in the fourth quarter (October through December), which is a key quarter for Zapf Creation, came in at approximately EUR 62 million, a decrease of just under 26 percent compared to the same period of fiscal year 2002. This figure includes sales of approximately EUR 5 million resulting from inventory realignment. As a result, inventories as of the end of December 2003 amounted to around EUR 31 million, which is almost identical to the previous year's level. The sales decline in America caused the operating result of this business unit to drop from more than EUR 9 million in 2002 to less than EUR 1 million in 2003. The inventory realignment carried out in December 2003 placed a further EUR 2 million strain on the operating earnings (EBIT). According to preliminary figures, the EBIT of approximately EUR 23.5 million was below the guidance of approximately EUR 26 million (2002: EUR 32.9 million).

       " 'Board of Directors and Supervisory Board of net AG and net mobile AG speak out against takeover of Open Mobile / net mobile pushes ahead with its activities in Asia In a meeting of the Supervisory Board just concluded, the Board of Directors and Supervisory Board of net mobile AG have unanimously spoken out against a takeover of Open Mobile Asia Pacific Pte Ltd., Singapore. The decision was made in close consultation with the management of net AG and subsequently confirmed in its entirety in a special teleconference session of the Supervisory Board of net AG. The decision was made based on the preliminary balance sheet submitted with respect to the takeover candidate, as prepared in connection with a routine due diligence review. Prepared by the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, the balance sheet indicated that considerable financial risks, which would heavily impact on the results of net mobile AG and net AG, could be expected in the event of a merger between net mobile and Open Mobile. The risks largely stem from different interpretations of the valuation in the balance sheet of goodwill at Open Mobile, and from the potential tax ramifications of the merger, which are very hard to assess in terms of their financial implications. The risks identified only came to light in the now finalized and available results of the due diligence review. The decision not to proceed with the takeover of Open Mobile has no appreciable impact on the financial position of net AG. Neither financial commitments nor guarantees were entered into and the negotiations did not entail significant additional costs to the company. The decision against this takeover, moreover, should by no means be considered a renunciation of the growth strategy in the Asian market. Quite to the contrary, net mobile AG will now continue to press ahead with the expansion activities it launched for Asia last year. Plans are now in place to expand staffing levels and technological capabilities at the existing branch office in Asia over the coming six to nine months, so that net mobile AG can play a dominant role in the Asian market for mobile value-added services. Nor does the management at net AG rule out takeovers as a strategic tool. However, there are no concrete consultations ongoing at this time as the Asian market for mobile value-added services is very fragmented. This is compounded by the fact that there are currently no candidates within view capable of fulfilling the requirements net AG has in terms of earnings strength and liquidity. net mobile will make use of this favourable initial situation to expand its successful business model in the Asian market, working together with its existing international partners.

       " \"Nokia Introduces a New Equity Program for 2004: January 22, 2004 - Increased Performance Orientation Through a Broad-Based Performance Shares Program - Significant Reduction in Number of Stock Options Nokia will introduce Performance Shares as the main element to its broad-based equity compensation program to further emphasize the performance element in employees' long-term incentives. As part of this change, the number of stock options to be granted will be significantly reduced as compared to 2003. The target group for this new share-based incentive program continues to be broad and to include a wide number of employees on many levels of the organization. However, the number of actual participants will be smaller as the program increases the focus on rewarding achievement and on retaining high potential and critical employees. The use of performance shares and stock options will build a more optimal and well-balanced combination of share-based compensation elements for Nokia's reward model. The new, more diversified program aligns the potential value received by participants directly with the performance of the company. No performance shares will vest unless the company performance reaches at least one of the threshold levels measured by two independent, pre-defined performance criteria: the company's Average Annual Net Sales Growth and EPS Growth (basic, reported) for 2004 to 2007. If required performance levels are achieved, the first payout will take place in 2006. The second and final payout, if applicable, will be in 2008. Under the 2004 Program, approved by the Nokia Board of Directors, the maximum performance level for both criteria will result in the vesting of the maximum of 17 million Performance Shares. If the threshold levels of performance are not achieved, none of the performance shares will vest. For performance between the threshold and maximum performance levels the payout follows a linear scale. Under the 2004 Program, Nokia will issue significantly fewer stock options for incentive purposes than in 2003 when approximately 30 million options were granted under the Stock Option Program out of the maximum 94.6 million as approved by the Annual General Meeting the same year. In 2004, the maximum number of Stock Options to be granted is 7 million. In addition, Nokia has used restricted shares on a very limited scale to retain high potential and critical employees. Going forward, the company will continue to use a limited number of Restricted Shares to recruit, retain, reward and motivate selected high potential and critical employees.

Clean Systems business division operating income weighed down by the semiconductor crisis, investment reservations in Germany and one-off expenditures. The current recovery of the electronics industry promises to boost Jenoptik Group sales and earnings in 2004. The Jenoptik technology group will complete fiscal year 2003 at just under 2 billion euros in sales (2002: 1.6bn euros). According to provisional calculations sales will come within the range predicted by Jenoptik in April 2003. Jenoptik will see in total a positive operating income for the year, but expects a net loss of more than 20 million euros in 2003. The Photonics business division's operating income will meet well with company expectations. The Clean Systems business division will fall behind projected figures, due to the semiconductor crisis, delays in projects during the first half of 2003 (a total of 15 to 20 million euros in positive income items will therefore not enter accounts until 2004), a large number of classical industrial orders, which generally had a below-average effect on earnings and the restructuring measures introduced over the past fiscal year (10 million euros). The Jenoptik Group net income will also be diminished by one-off expenditures of about 9m euros due to the capital measures carried out in autumn 2003. In total the net income was thus burdened by one-off expenditures of about 40m euros in fiscal year 2003. Order intake reached a new record this past fiscal year, rising roughly 2.8 percent from 2002 (2.14bn euros) to approximately 2.2 billion euros. Order backlog also rose in the course of the year, reaching 2.48 billion euros (2.39bn euros), an increase of 3.8 percent. Order intake is also lively at the beginning of the year. The Jenoptik Group expects 2004 sales to surpass those of 2003 due to its high order backlog and excellent order intake and the recovery of the electronics industry. The increase in sales will also affect operating income positively. The Clean Systems Technologies business division is particularly expected to return to its earlier solid income figures\",\n",

Incoming orders in the third quarter were just short of Euro 1 billion. They thus matched the previous quarter and, after adjustments for currency fluctuations, were on a par with the previous year. Sales in the period under review were Euro 2.5 billion (previous year: Euro 2.9 billion). Adjusted for currency effects, this represents a fall of 9 percent compared with the previous year. Sales in the third quarter were just below Euro 1 billion and as such were well above sales in the previous quarters. The operating result for the period under review improved compared to the half- yearly figure by Euro 3 million to a loss of Euro 90 million (previous year: Euro 48 million). In conjunction with the new alignment, the company set aside a total of Euro 525 million in the third quarter for non-recurring expenditure, predominantly depreciations on book values. This results in an income before tax of Euro minus 685 million (previous year: Euro minus121 million). The net loss per December 31, 2003 was Euro minus 725 million (previous year: Euro minus 82 million).

The total revenue for the first three quarters of the current business year therefore came in at EUR 237.7m (+16%). At EUR 7.4m EBIT was 9% above that of last year. This constitutes an accumulated EBIT of EUR 19.7m for the first three quarters of the current business year (+20%). In the third quarter the EBIT margin of 8.6% was below that of the second quarter, however, clearly above that of the first quarter. This cumulated EBIT margin amounts to 8.3% for the current business year. The reason for this sequential downturn is the price pressure that still persists for AT&S, as a consequence of the weak US dollar, although it has generally become less severe. The quarterly profit before tax was EUR 8m, also due to a much improved financial result. This means an increase of 65% compared to the third quarter of the previous business year. The pre-tax profit for the first three quarters is therefore EUR 16.4m (+16%). Net income was EUR 6.5m in the third quarter of the current business year. Earnings per share were EUR 0.25 in the third quarter. Thus AT&S achieved a net income of EUR 10.8m in the first three quarters, which is 29% more than in the 2002/03 business year.

Running at some 272 million euros, revenue levels will even exceed the target corridor that was adjusted upwards in October 2003 to 255 to 260 million euros. Earnings before taxes (EBT) are expected to be some 22 million euros, which is again higher than the 17 million euros forecast in October. The previous year, the specialist in high-performance plastic components generated 9.5 million euros in EBT. That translates into a 132-percent increase. Balda is expecting earnings per share (EPS) to run between 31 and 32 cents in fiscal 2003. One key growth driver in 2003 was the Infocom division, which has production sites in Germany and Asia. Although demand for mobile phones is traditionally strong in the fourth quarter, it was much greater than mobile-phone manufacturers had anticipated. This helped Balda to reach new incoming-order and production-resource-utilization records in the closing quarter of the past financial year. The group also succeeded in increasing its market share as a system partner for mobile-phone manufacturers from 10 to some 13 percent in 2003. As in previous years, the Managing and Supervisory Boards plan to recommend a dividend amounting to one third of the earnings per share at the annual general meeting. This would add up to some 10 cents, as opposed to last year's dividend of 5 cents per share. The Managing Board is forecasting that 2004 will see revenues grow organically by some 16 percent to reach 315 to 320 million euros. EBT for 2004 is projected to be between 27 and 28 million euros, representing a year-on-year increase of some 25 percent. This would mark yet another year in which Balda grew faster than its core market of mobile-phone manufacturers. This trend is expected to be driven by skyrocketing revenues in the growth markets served by the Asia production sites.

       " 'Sauer-Danfoss updates earnings outlook for 2003 Chicago/Neumünster, January 28, 2004. Sauer-Danfoss Inc. expects fourth quarter 2003 net sales of approximately $263.0 million (fourth quarter 2002: $221,2) and a net loss in the range of $9.0 million to $11.0 million, or $0.19 to $0.23 per share (same period last year: -$1.7 million, or -$0.03 per share). The results are reflective of restructuring costs, one-time write-offs and field recall costs accumulating to about $0.15 per share. A loss of margin related to the weaker US dollar added another $0.03 per share. For the full-year 2003, net sales are expected in excess of $1.1 billion (2002: $952.3). Full-year 2003 net income is expected to be $8.0 million to $10.0 million, or $0.17 to $0.21 per share (2002: $14.0 million, or $0.29 per share). For the full year, earnings are impacted by restructuring and one-time charges accumulating to about $0.17, of which more than $0.10 were from costs with no cash effect. Taking these out along with the special charges from the field recall issues of about $0.10, the normal operating annual earnings should come in at or above $0.40 per share, in line with the range of earnings guidance given earlier in the year. The cash flow from operations is expected to come within $10.0 million of the record performance in the full prior year, when Sauer-Danfoss generated almost $100.0 million. Due to the recent restructuring Sauer-Danfoss is well prepared for the full year 2004 and is expecting to grow the business and its market share in a market expected to expand strongly. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 28.01.2004',\n",

With EUR 428 million in equity raised, closed-end real estate funds were once again the strongest business segment (previous year: EUR 215 million). Apart from the Dutch and Canadian funds, the first Austrian fund with an equity of EUR 146 million, which was fully placed in the fourth quarter, generated growth of almost 100% in this segment. In view of the continuous product offering of a fleet of over 30 ships to be placed by the year 2006 and the attractive market environment, investors contributed EUR 190 million (previous year: EUR 96 million) to ship investments offered by the Hamburg-based issuing house. A total of EUR 199 million were placed in the \"Corporate Investments\" segment in 2003, compared to EUR 111 in 2002. The product line of the life insurance funds was continued successfully. Following the first fund with an equity volume of EUR 28 million launched in 2002, a total of EUR 107 million were placed in three funds in the past fiscal year. With EUR 6 million in equity raised, the Private Equity segment was in line with expectations (previous year: EUR 17 million). The price trend and the relocation or closure of three equity funds resulted in an outflow of just under EUR 2 million in the open-end investment funds. At EUR 738 million, total equity placed in 2003 exceeded the compan\\'s expectations (EUR 640 million), which was attributable to the successful placements in the fourth quarter.

The company thus exceeded the balanced result that had been announced following the nine-months figures. However, the consolidated net income of 3.1 million euros (previous year: consolidated net loss of 15.8 million euros) does not suffice to offset the loss carried forward from the prior year.

EUR 32 million. Total sales for the fiscal year 2003 amounted to around EUR 93 million (2002: EUR 127,5 million). As a result the company reached its primary target to achieve at least a balanced free cash flow. This favorable cash development led to more than EUR 26 million funds and accordingly, after deduction of bank loans, to more than EUR 23 million cash on-hand. As in previous years, also in 2003, Q4 was by far the strongest quarter in terms of sales. Nevertheless the more cautious increase in demand for machines for short term delivery at the end of the year showed that the upturn is still to come for our market segment. This was also reflected in Q4 order entry, which at approx. EUR 25 million remained within the range of the previous quarters. The negative exchange rate development of the US-Dollar with respect to the Euro had a significant impact on order entry as well as sales numbers, because approximately one third of the total business was done in the Dollar zone. The resulting currency losses also impacted the group earning figures therefore, we have to expect also the resulting fourth quarter figures to be negative. Without losses related to the weak dollar and other extraordinary effects including a correction of assets based on loss carry forward, the results for the fourth quarter would have been positive. For fiscal year 2004 a significant increase in order entry is expected beginning during the first half year, which will have a favorable impact on sales and earnings. This expectation is based on released investment plans from our customers and subsequent contract negotiations, which we expect to finalize in the coming months. SUSS MicroTec will announce its final, audited figures and results for the business year 2003 on March 29, 2004 after offical hours',\n",

Shareholders' equity up by 22%; marked reduction in liabilities Number of shares in free float doubles to over 24% DEWB AG (Deutsche Effecten- und Wechsel-Beteiligungsgesellschaft) increased sales by 11% to 30.7 million euros in 2003 (2002: 27.7m euros). The proceeds mainly came from the sales of the stake in 7 investments. In this process DEWB used virtually the entire range of exit channels - e.g. trade sales, buybacks as well as sales of securities - and also profited from the rising valuation of the technology sector. The realised investments sales made significant contributions to the result. EBITDA for 2003 is 7.3 million euros (2002: 0.2m euros). Value adjustments of 7.3 million euros, which were applied to several early-phase investments as well as securities, had a negative impact on the result. These adjustments, however, were significantly lower than in 2002 (19.3m euros). DEWB reports a small positive EBIT for 2003 (2002: -19.3m euros). After tax and interest this gives a net loss of minus 1.6 million euros (2002: -22.2m euros) which corresponds to earnings per share of minus 0.12 euros (2002: -1.96 euros). Taking a long-term view, DEWB is one of the most profitable European investment companies with an average annual return on investments of 41% (five-year IRR). In 2003 DEWB significantly improved its balance sheet structure. The shareholders' equity rose by 22% to 37.4 million euros, which corresponds to 2.83 euros per share. Liabilities fell by 8.0 million euros to 65.6 million euros. DEWB's liquid funds rose substantially amounting to 17.5 million euros or 1.32 euros per share at the end of the year. The main reason for this clear improvement in the ratio is the successful placement of the capital increase in December 2003. This has also improved the attractiveness of the DEWB share: the number of shares held in free float more than doubled to 24.3%, strongly improving the tradability of the share.

       " \"Until into the Christmas sales season the Wolford Group registered positive sales momentum that further cushioned the significant decreases witnessed earlier in the fiscal year. However, this trend gave way to a subdued pattern in January. The fall/winter end-of-season sales did not meet expectations and the until then significant positive impetus from prompt orders was absent in January. This brought revenues in the first three quarters of fiscal 2003/04 to EUR 90.4 million compared to EUR 98.8 million in the year before, a reduction of 8.5% in the Group's reporting currency. In the third fiscal quarter, bottlenecks at suppliers delayed the filling of a significant number of orders, leading to an unusually high order level at the end of the period and thus shifting sales from the third to the fourth quarter. Nearly half (4.0 percentage points) of the sales contraction was attributable to exchange rate movements and about one-quarter (2.2 percentage points) represented the sales of unprofitable own outlets that were closed down. While brand sales (accounting for about 96% of total sales) were stable, contract manufacturing revenue fell by 30% in the past three quarters. For this reason the distribution activities are focused on - among other strategies for business development - winning further private-label partners. As in the first two quarters, looking at the performance of the distribution channels, a positive sales trend emerged in the Retail business, which consists of the boutiques owned by Wolford. The sales share of these outlets was boosted to 27.0%. Sales through this channel grew by 3% year-over-year on a like-for- like basis. Holger Dahmen, Wolford's CEO since January 7, sees this development as validating its strategy of presenting the brand in a manner appropriate to its premium market segment and controlling the value chain consistently all the way to the end-consumer. For the fiscal fourth quarter the management expects the sales decline to ease, and thus projects sales below the year-earlier level. The sales figures reported here represent preliminary data\",\n",

The sales of LEONI Flex (EUR 9 million in 2003 and EUR 11 million in 2002) are no longer included as the company was sold in December 2003. The fact that sales did not quite match the previous year's figure is attributable to the impact of currency translation due to the strong euro. After adjusting for exchange rates, the Company generated an increase in sales of about two percent. At EUR 21.2 million, provisional net profit has turned out less than the figure budgeted at the beginning of 2003. In the previous year, net profit adjusted for the extraordinary effect of changes in accounting principles amounted to EUR 30.4 million. The sharper decline is due to the sale of French subsidiary LEONI Flex as well as exceptional charges associated with shutting down the wire and strand production of LEONI Felisi in Italy in the fourth quarter of 2003. The Wiring Systems Division was not able to entirely detach itself from the weak state of the global automotive business. Moreover, some key customers' impending model changes meant further loss of sales. In total, the Wiring Systems Division (excluding LEONI Flex) generated sales of about EUR 558 million (EUR 588 million in 2002), which is in line with the forecast decrease of roughly five percent. In the Cable Division, the strategic focus on four different markets and being present in the regions of most significant growth paid off.

In terms of software solutions, the company managed to keep its revenue - at EUR 8.5m - around the same as the year before (EUR 8.6m), with license revenues clearly failing to meet expectations in the 4th quarter in particular. The revenue of EUR 46.8m in the consulting segment shows a slight decrease (EUR 48.4m). Earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation (EBITDA) reached EUR 4.3m (EUR 4.9m), while the operating income (EBIT) amounted to EUR 1.4m (EUR 1.9m). When comparing these figures, you should note that - seeing as the theGuard! software developed in house had become ready for marketing - REALTECH has not capitalized any further development expenses in accordance with US GAAP since the 4th quarter of 2002. Compared to the previous year, this results in a EUR 0.6m drop in earnings for 2003.

Consolidated net income grew by more than a third to EUR 3.5m (previous year: EUR 2.5m). This is mainly attributable to a continued improvement in the gross margin of 43.7% due to innovative products and optimised manufacturing costs (previous year: 40.4%). Changes in exchange rates between the euro and US dollar and Japanese yen caused sales to fall slightly (by 3.3%) to EUR 58.4m compared to EUR 60.4m in the same period of the previous year.

Activities have been expanded, particularly in the marketing & sales and research & development sectors, in order to set the stage for planned growth. Despite this, the EBIT margin increased slightly over the previous year. In the first quarter the latter stood at 10.5% (previous year: 10.2%). This corresponds to a value of EUR 6.1m (previous year: EUR 6.1m). There has been a significant improvement in cash flow from operating activities.

       " \"Ludwigsburg, 12 February 2004 --- In the first nine months of its financial year BERU Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigsburg, increased its consolidated sales revenues by 15.9% from EUR 214.3 million to EUR 248.3 million. Once again, the Electronics and Sensor Technology division posted the strongest growth in sales: at EUR 58.5 (43.4) million the figure was 34.8% higher than in the prior year. Sales revenues from electronic tire pressure monitoring systems were up from EUR 13.4 million to EUR 21.7 million for the first nine months, so BERU reached an increase of 61.9%. DVFA/SG earnings per share adjusted for one off effects of EUR 2.68 (2.21) were 21.3% higher than in the first nine months of 2002/03. EBIT (before one off effects) for the period grew by 22% to EUR 41.6 million, after EUR 34.1 million in the prior year. In the previous year, BERU had realized a capital gain of EUR 3.8 from the sale of investments in other companies. Nonetheless, operating profit, which also includes such one-time gains from the sale of shares in other companies, increased to EUR 42.1 (37.9) million. Due to the low levels of interest rates, net financial income decreased from EUR 2.3 million to EUR 1.9 million. Impairment charges totaling EUR 0.3 million were recognized on fixed-interest securities in the current assets. The company thus achieved pre-tax earnings of EUR 44.0 (40.2) million, 9.5% more than in the prior year. Despite a significant increase in the effective tax rate to 37.7% (33.1%), net income also rose, by 1.9% to EUR 27.4 (26.9) million. BERU once again demonstrated its financial strength with an increase in cash flow of more than 3% from EUR 43.0 million to EUR 44.4 million. The Chairman of the Executive Board Marco von Maltzan stated, that depending on the start-up speed of the new projects, BERU assumes that the company will at least achieve the goal for the full year of increasing sales revenues by 15% with a 15% EBIT margin. After achieving breakeven with the tire pressure monitoring system, BERU now plans for the ISS and the PTC to breakeven as well in the upcoming quarters. 2004/05 will also be a year of start-ups - eight are planned with new products - and double- digit organic growth, and the company looks forward to this challenge. As ever, the focus is not simply on revenue growth per se, but to strenghten the company's profitability. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 12.02.2004\",\n",

The Nemetschek Group, one of the leading vendors of software and consulting services for the design, construction and management of buildings and real estate, concluded fiscal 2003 according to plan. According to preliminary and unaudited figures sales revenues amounted to EUR 95.6 million and thus reflect an expected decline as compared to the previous year (EUR 105.5 million). Despite the decrease in sales, operating income (EBIT) increased to EUR 5.7 million (previous year: EUR -7.9 million). The Group's net income rose to EUR 3.9 million (previous year: EUR -11.7 million). Compared to the previous year's value liquid assets were raised by EUR 8.7 million to EUR 29.8 million as of Dec. 31, 2003. The decrease in sales in the German market reflects the continued difficult economic situation and the further decline in building investments. The proportion of international sales amounted to 43 %. The Group's sales revenues are negatively affected by currency and deconsolidation effects in the amount of more than EUR 4 million. With these results Nemetschek confirms its forecasts. The trend reversal in operating results was not only achieved by the extensive cost reductions of the previous years but also by increases in efficiency throughout the Group.

Compared with the same quarter of 2002, there was a strong improvement of 187%. Due to the extensive revaluation of the investments and securities portfolio amounting to 2,325m euros, as of September 30, and also to the restructuring expenses already booked in the first quarter of 2003 (104m euros), the bank is posting a net loss of 2,320m euros for the year as a whole. Here, high tax expenses (249m euros) also have to be taken into consideration. As a result of the clean-up operation, the revaluation reserve is positive at 1,240m euros.

Concentration on profitable, sustainable products CENTROTEC Hochleistungskunststoffe AG, Brilon, reports overall revenue of EUR 115.7 million (unaudited) for the past 2003 financial year, and consequently an increase of 18% on the previous year (EUR 98.4 million). The revenue plans of EUR 110-115 million have therefore actually been surpassed. The increase in revenue is attributable both to organic growth (8%) and to two new acquisitions in the course of 2003 (10%), Ned Air (Climate Systems) and Möller Medical. Both companies have been included in consolidation since around mid-2003. This has moreover underpinned the prospects of achieving the earnings forecast (EPS before goodwill amortization of EUR 1.00-1.05). The growth reported by the Systems Division for its cutting-edge environmental products for low-energy heating and ventilation systems was particularly satisfying. The stable revenue growth that has regularly been posted for this area of activity endorses CENTROTEC's strategy of evolving into a company for sustainable environmental and health products. The plans for 2004 will be in line with CENTROTEC's medium-term objectives of multi-year average EPS growth of 20-30%.

For the first time since the IPO, the Girindus Group reported positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The positive trend displayed by the EBIDTA of the consolidated Girindus Group during the past fiscal year was much stronger than initially assumed. The audited figures showed that the company had achieved balanced results in 2003; it was the first time this had happened since the Company's debut on the German Stock Exchange. This was all the more remarkable in that it took place despite unfavorable conditions such as the sluggish economy and the price pressure Girindus faced on the U.S. pharmaceutical market as a result of the strong Euro. The leap forward in operating results was even more pronounced at Girindus AG, which reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of about 40,000 Euro at the end of 2003. The company expects that its current project portfolio will fuel another growth spurt during the coming years. In addition to a large number of pharmaceutical projects at early stages of development, the portfolio includes ten important projects at the late clinical phases II and III. These projects involve innovative drug actives effective against cancer, cardiovascular disease, ophthalmologic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, tropical diseases and metabolic disorders. Following approval by the regulatory authorities, each of these new products is expected to generate sizable additional revenues and earnings.

Net loss reduced by 69 percent from EUR (179.0) million in 2002 to EUR (56.1) million in 2003. This improvement was due to comprehensive cost cutting measures in 2003 as well as a goodwill impairment loss of EUR (100.4) million in 2002. Adjusted for this impairment loss net loss reduced by 29 percent. LYCOS Europe`s cash, cash equivalents and deposits amounted to EUR 175.2 million on December 31, 2003. LYCOS Europe recorded total revenues of EUR 85.0 million in 2003 compared to EUR 118.0 million in 2002. This decline of 28 percent is primarily due to the sale of group companies in 2002 and 2003 and the loss of an advertising agreement with a main shareholder in 2002. Adjusted for these non-recurring items, LYCOS Europe`s total revenues increased by 8 percent.

       " 'init anticipates 2003 sales and earnings to stay below previous year init innovation in traffic systems AG is expected to close the 2003 financial year with sales and earnings figures below prior year levels. Due in part to the devaluation of the US dollar, the reasons for this are found in the delay of a number of large-scale projects. These delays have led to a failure of sales and income originally calculated for 2003 to make the books by the end of the year. Thus, init now anticipates sales of just over 30 million Euro. The operating result (EBIT) will be below the prior-year figure, though clearly in the positive range. The provisional figures will be published within the next two weeks following the completion of the consolidated financial statements. The audited figures for the 2003 financial year, the full report of the Managing Board, and detailed prospects for 2004 will be published by init in time for the press conference on financial statements on March 29, 2004.

In advance of these results, ORAD is now able to give shareholders an update on trading performance for this period. Turnover has grown in 2003 and is expected to be around $15.3m (2002: $14.5m). This figure does not take account of a major project for the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which the Company had hoped to be able to book in 2003. However, delays resulting from the SARS epidemic in final implementation of the Jockey Club system mean that the acceptance testing has slipped into 2004. To date the system has been used at several major race meetings in Hong Kong and we hope to receive final acceptance during the first half of 2004. We expect to be able to book $3m of sales for this project and consequently for it to make a major contribution to operating results in 2004.

In order to simplify the group structures, with economic effect from January 1, 2005 GEA AG (GEA) is to be incorporated into mg. In preparation for this measure, mg today asked the Executive Board of GEA to initiate proceedings for the squeeze- out of free-float GEA shareholders in accordance with Section 327a of the German Stock Corporation Act. At present, mg holds more than 98 percent of the GEA capital stock in ordinary and preferred shares. As such it is entitled to demand that the GEA General Meeting resolve to transfer the shares of the remaining shareholders (the minority shareholders) to mg against an appropriate cash settlement. In conjunction with these measures, the merger of holding staff functions of mg and GEA is being prepared. An alternative location is Bochum. The consistent efforts to give a leaner look to Lurgi and Lurgi Lentjes, which belong to mg's industrial plant engineering business, are being continued. What is decisive here is the focus on profitable, low-risk in-house technologies. Low yield areas are to be spun off. The reduction of around 500 jobs in industrial plant engineering will proceed on schedule thru 2006. This will result in a considerably lower break-even point. According to preliminary figures for business 2003, the mg Group posted sales of Euro 8.2 billion*. The increased burden on profits placed by industrial plant engineering resulted in a pre-tax loss of Euro 241 million*, as opposed to the expected loss of around Euro 170 million* announced last October. The preliminary Group EBT was influenced by one-time factors and extraordinary charges totaling Euro 437 million*, for the most part from industrial plant engineering. These include value impairments to reflect contract risks and the ending of long-term legal disputes as well as portfolio adjustments with the spin-off of loss-making business activities. In addition high costs were incurred in re-aligning mg and giving it a considerably leaner group organization. Thanks to their sound business performance GEA and Dynamit Nobel - after adjusting for extraordinary items - generated an current profit of more than Euro 200 million, each judging by the preliminary figures.

       " \"Discontinuation of PC business places significant burden on 4MBO 2003 results Group turnover falls due to decline in PC sales to 213.1 million euros - EBIT stands at minus 19.0 million euros Despite all the turbulence - focus on consumer electronics and digital entertainment electronics Plochingen, 25 February 2004 - 4MBO International Electronic AG (ISIN DE0005487805) ended its 2003 financial year with high losses. The first reason for the company's negative annual result was the collapse in its PC business in the fourth quarter of 2003. The second reason was the closure of its PC division and the high associated costs thereby incurred; a sale of the division was not an option in view of the currently tense nature of the IT distribution sector as a whole. The PC and notebook sales that were down by up to 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 combined with the intensification in pressure applied by competitors and on margins in the second half of the year were the causes behind the fall in annual turnover, according to provisional calculations, by some 26 percent to 213.1 million euros (as compared with 287.0 million euros in the previous year). This collapse in turnover had an immediate impact on the operating result, which is set to stand at around minus 9.9 million euros without the costs associated with the closure of the IT division. The costs incurred in closing down the IT sector will probably amount to 11.8 million euros, thus placing a significant burden on the results generated in the 2003 financial year. The costs include depreciation on goodwill, warranty reserves for the 4MBO PC that is currently on the market as well as severance payments for the members of staff that have been dismissed. For 2003, the provisional operating result before interest and tax (EBIT) stands in total at minus 19.0 million euros (minus 9.3 million euros in previous year). The financial result of minus 6.5 million euros (minus 2.1 million euros in previous year) is a further factor impacting negatively on the annual result. Interest expenses amounting to 3.6 million euros due to higher loan levels and an increase in finance costs were incurred because the losses generated in 2002 lead to 4MBO's credit rating being downgraded. Moreover, depreciation on affiliated companies of 2.9 million euros occurred. The result of the company's ordinary business activities (EBT) thus stood at minus 25.5 million euros (compared with minus 11.4 million euros in previous year). Despite the sharp downturn in the IT sector, the current order inventory worth some 40 million euros is testimony to the high demand for 4MBO's consumer electronics products. The wind-down of the PC and notebook business opens up new perspectives above all for digital entertainment electronics in a growing, innovation-driven market. The company's first successful sales activities with digital satellite receivers already took place in December 2003 and January 2004. Further projects involving, for instance, digital hard-disk recorders are in the pipeline. The final figures for the 2003 financial year are to be published on 25 March 2004 at the balance sheet press conference in Stuttgart\",\n",

       " 'Jack White Productions AG acquires a music catalogue featuring more than 51,000 licenses Total license holdings more than doubled Group emerges as one of the world\\'s largest independent music license-holders Berlin, February 26, 2004 - Berlin-based Jack White Productions AG has acquired a catalogue of over 51,000 recordings by world-famous artists and hits from various segments of the music business. The purchase was made through the company\\'s US subsidiary JWP USA Inc., Miami, and means that the Jack White Group now owns a total back catalogue that has more than doubled from over 36,000 to in excess of 87,000 licenses. At one fell swoop, JWP AG has thus established itself as one of the world\\'s largest independent music license-holders. And the Company has achieved its crucial strategic goal far faster than originally expected. By mutual agreement, confidentiality will be maintained on the purchase price. The acquisition was financed using part of the proceeds from the ongoing Jack White Productions AG capital increase. The legendary back catalogue was sold by Davon Music Corp. and The Everest Record Group. The companies own a total of ten renowned international labels with recordings from a variety of different types of music. For example, they feature jazz, folk, classical, Pop, R&B and World Music titles, including music legends such as Ray Charles and Duke Ellington, Pop stars such as The Olympics and classical recordings by the likes of Maria Callas, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic orchestras and the Prague Symphony Orchestra. Jack White Productions AG licenses and copyrights are exploited world-wide in the form of compilation LPs and by awarding licenses for use of the music in films, on the radio/TV or for ads. The extension of the distribution agreement with Universal Music Group in the USA as at the end of 2003 will also be beneficial. Universal is a valuable partner, above all for the back catalogue business, and as the market leader is in a position to optimally exploit the JWP AG-held licenses. Moreover, the high-quality back list provides invaluable content for the fast-growing utilization of music titles via online services. The back catalogue business comes under Jack White Productions AG\\'s highly profitable \"Labels\" segment and thus forms an important cornerstone for the Jack White Group\\'s earnings power. Moreover, thanks to the versatile potential for exploiting the licenses, JWP AG will become increasingly less exposed to short- term music-industry trends and the hit business.

Softing recorded sales revenues of EUR 5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 (2002: EUR 5.8 million). As a result, sales revenues for the full fiscal year increased by more than 7% to EUR 20.3 million (2002: EUR 18.9 million). At EUR 0.1 million, the result from operations for fiscal 2003 was on target. The final extraordinary repositioning expenditures amounted to approximately EUR 0.5 million. They primarily comprise the closure of the Italian subsidiary and the reduction of the Executive Board. Taking into account these expenditures, the operating result was EUR -0.4 million (2002: EUR -6.9 million), which is an impressive improvement of EUR 6.5 million in just one year and underscores the successful reorientation of Softing. The operating result in the fourth quarter came in at EUR 0.1 million (2002: EUR -3.4 million). The incoming orders in the Softing Group amounted to EUR 20.1 million (2002: EUR 20.4 million). This item was impacted by extraordinary effects in 2002. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2003 were EUR 6.0 million, up EUR 1.1 million compared to the previous year (EUR 4.9 million). In the fourth quarter alone, cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 0.8 million. The Executive Board of Softing AG does not expect the economy to improve noticeably before mid 2004. Nevertheless, Softing expects incoming orders and sales revenues to increase in fiscal 2004. The company's plans call for revenues to grow to more than EUR 21 million, of which about two thirds will probably be attributable to the second half of the year.

       " 'STADA expands oncologics business with a strategic partnership with LipoNova STADA has today entered into a strategic partnership with LipoNova in the field of oncology. LipoNova GmbH, founded in 1998, is based in Hanover, Germany, and conducts development projects in the field of tumor vaccination. Today STADA has acquired approx. 16 percent of the shares in LipoNova GmbH at a price of approx. EUR 6.4 million from the previous shareholders. At the same time, STADA has acquired the exclusive European marketing rights in Reniale, a LipoNova product currently in the approval process. Once Reniale has been launched in the market, STADA will pay sales-related royalties for these rights. The tumor vaccination offered by LipoNova involves removing cancer patients own tumor cells and treating them using a special process developed by LipoNova. These cells are then injected back into the patient intradermally. This stimulates the bodys own defenses and, consequently, its ability to fight the cancer. In December 2003, LipoNova applied for Europe-wide approval for Reniale, the first product with this mode of action, from the EMEA, the European agency responsible for approving innovative drugs. This first autologous tumor vaccine is aimed at the adjuvant treatment of certain stages of renal cell carcinoma. This type of cancer affects no more than 70,000 people per year in the EU. LipoNova has therefore already obtained orphan drug status for Reniale, the status given to drugs that treat rare diseases. Approval for such drugs grants market exclusivity which, depending on country, is valid for between six and ten years. Under the cooperation agreements signed today, STADA will also acquire from the same sellers a further approx. 16 percent of the shares in LipoNova at a price of approx. EUR 8 million after the targeted EMEA approval for Reniale is granted. The strategic partnership with LipoNova will give STADA the opportunity for the first time to offer an innovative cancer therapy product in its own product portfolio without having to conduct any proprietary research into the active ingredient. Thus STADA can further expand its oncologics business in the core segment of specialty pharmaceuticals',\n",

The result includes additional expenditure for the integration of Dr. Koch Computertechnik AG and earnings from the sale of tec2b AG. The improvement to the result was also accompanied by a decrease in turnover from 116.1 million euros to 81.6 million euros. The reasons for this decrease were the sale of tec2b AG on 30 September 2003 and the continuing weakness of economic activity in the IT sector. The focus on strategic business areas resulted in an improved relative gross margin of approx. 22% in 2003. As a special effect, deferred taxes on losses carried forward were reduced by 3.4 million euros, in particular due to new legislation on offsetting of losses passed in December 2003.

In the first quarter of this fiscal year the Nordex Group's operating business stabilized further. At EUR 55.5 mn, order receipts were above budget and higher than new business in the two previous quarters (EUR 50 mn and EUR 30 mn, respectively). It is only to a limited extent possible to make a direct comparison with order receipts in the first quarter of 2002/2003 as Nordex has applied stricter criteria for recording new orders since January 1, 2003. The company's business volume has also increased again. At EUR 66.7 mn, revenues in the period under review were higher than that of the past three quarters despite the more restrictive application of the percentage-of-completion method. Nordex generated approx. 68% of revenues in Germany. This is due, above all, to seasonal effects, the return to reliable planning in the wake of the amendment of the Renewable Energies Act and increasing customer confidence. Some 60% of the turbines installed by Nordex in Germany in 2003 went on grid in the period under review alone. In comparison to the first quarter of 2003/2003, the loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) has been almost halved to EUR 6.7 mn (previous year EUR 11.9 mn). The cost-of-materials ratio decreased to 84% (previous year 88.6%) and the balance of Other Operating Expenses and Income fell by 49% to EUR 5.6 mn. Thanks to staff cuts started in spring 2003, personnel expenditure fell by 17% to EUR 8.9 mn. As at December 31, 2003, the Group employed 142 fewer staff than in the previous year (897 employees). No more one-off items were incurred. In the previous year Nordex had streamlined its balance sheet in the form of risk provisions and value adjustments. The improvement in the operating result is the one of the first results of the restructuring commenced in summer 2003. The key points of this are the optimization of business processes and radical cost cutting on the basis of both technical and commercial measures. The Group's liquidity trend was positive for the second quarter in succession. Free cash flow amounted to EUR 7.2 mn (previous year EUR -28.1 mn) and working capital decreased by EUR 9.4 mn to EUR 70.3 mn compared to the previous quarter.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) improved by around EUR 4 million to EUR 1.55 million (2002: EUR -5.40 million); however, despite this decisive improvement, these results did not meet original plans. Following the acquisition of MIS AG goodwill impairments on individual operations depressed results by EUR 1.89 million. The recoverability of specific balance sheet items relating to these entities was also subject to a critical review. These one time adjustments amounted to EUR 2.77 million in total. Nevertheless, the net loss for the year was reduced by almost EUR 10 million to EUR -1.94 million or EUR -0.57 per share (2002: EUR -11.62 million/EUR -3.42 per share). Although MIS does not see sustained growth potential in its national market for 2004 the Management Board expects growth in MIS' international operations\",\n",

       " \"SGL Carbon: Profit from operations for 2003 up significantly year-on-year Net loss widens due to one-time charges affecting net financing costs Wiesbaden, March 1, 2004. The SGL Carbon Group recorded sales revenue for 2003 of around EUR1.05 billion (2002: EUR1.11 billion). Sales revenue was hit by declining demand in a number of business areas due to economic factors, as well as the slide of the US dollar against the euro. Adjusted for currency translation effects, sales revenue increased slightly. Profit from operations up sharply At its meeting today, the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements. SGL Carbon's profit from operations before costs relating to antitrust proceedings and restructuring was up around one-third year-on-year at EUR39 million (2002: EUR29 million). The profit from operations after restructuring expenses also improved by around 45 percent on the previous year, to approximately EUR29 million. As part of its review of all provisions for antitrust risks, the Company increased the provision set up in Q3/2003 for the fine relating to its non-core Graphite Specialties activities to just under EUR20 million. SGL Carbon believes that the fine of EUR23.6 million imposed on the Company by the European Commission in December 2003 is unjustified and has appealed to the European Court. The profit from operations after all one-time expenses was well up on the previous year at EUR9 million (2002: loss of EUR2 million). Net financing costs hit by one-time charges Interest on borrowings and the interest component of the addition to pension provisions remained unchanged year-on-year at EUR37 million in total. All in all, net financing costs for 2003 amounted to EUR73 million. The difference of EUR36 million is largely due to the following one-time factors: the successful refinancing at the start of 2004 meant that the remaining costs from the previous financing package amounting to EUR16 million had to be derecognized. Net financing costs were also affected to the tune of EUR20 million by the non- cash imputed interest on liabilities arising from the North American antitrust proceedings (EUR6 million) and an interest charge on the disputed European antitrust proceedings (EUR6 million), as well as other charges (EUR8 million). Net loss increased As a result of the clear turnaround in our business in the USA, SGL Carbon has recognized a first portion of the loss carryforwards there on the basis of a conservative estimate. This resulted in a tax income of EUR10 million. Due to the substantial one-time costs relating to refinancing and antitrust proceedings, the net loss widened significantly year-on-year to around EUR50 million (2002: EUR24 million). SGL Carbon will present the comprehensive figures for 2003 at its annual press conference on March 16, 2004 in Frankfurt am Main. A confident outlook for fiscal 2004 SGL Carbon expects a moderate economic recovery in 2004. Due to further restructuring and efficiency-enhancing measures, higher prices for graphite electrodes and demand-driven improvements in results at Graphite Specialties and SGL Technologies, the Company is forecasting a substantial increase in its profit from operations in the current fiscal year. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 01.03.2004\",\n",

After-tax earnings rose 29 percent in 2003, to 19.6 million euros (2002: 15.2 million euros). Earnings per share increased from 1.13 euros to 1.45 euros in 2003. As already reported in advance, the Group's volume of new business grew, i.e. total acquisition costs of newly purchased leased assets rose from 278 million euros in 2002 to 309 million euros in 2003, which represents an 11 percent increase in new business. The margin of new business (contribution margin 1), which yields financial income over the lifetime of a contract and which is thus a key indicator of the profitability of new business, also saw a disproportionately sharp rise to 33.9 million euros in 2003 (previous year: 28.5 million euros).

       " \"Preliminary figures for the business year of 2003 In 2003 CeWe Color cash flow amounts to Euro 46.5 million (-2.3 %) Oldenburg, March 2, 2004 - In the business year of 2003, CeWe Color Holding AG (SDAX, ISDN DE 000 540 3901) - the largest independent photofinisher in Europe - maintained its cash flow, which amounted to Euro 46.5 million, at almost the same level as that of last year, at Euro 47.6 million. Earnings before tax (EBT), at Euro 13.2 million, and corporate profits after tax, at Euro 3.6 million, are below last year's levels, namely 24.6 % and 60.4 % respectively. The drop in comparison to profits generated in the previous year is largely due to increases in depreciations (2003: 42.9 million Euro, +11.4 %). A total of Euro 6.2 million of this sum is for depreciation of the goodwill of Konica Photo Service (KPSF) alone. Temporary negative effects of IAS accounting - Instructions of the Deutsche Börse AG made it necessary for CeWe Color to switch its accounting system from HGB to IAS in 2003. This has resulted in additional, albeit temporary, increases in depreciation, amounting to approximately Euro 6 million per year in comparison to HGB accounting. A one-time tax increase of Euro 1.2 million in tax arrears occurred as a result of a fiscal audit for 1993 to 1999 - in addition to Euro 700,000 interest in arrears which burden interest earned. Sales volume increases by 0.2 % to 3,402 million colour prints - CeWe Color was able to slightly raise its sales volume in comparison to that of last year by 0.2 %, to 3,402 million colour prints (2002: 3,395 million colour prints). Growth in the number of digital photos, at 339 %, from 38.8 million photos to 170.3 million in 2003, exceeded expectations. While digital camera owners are ordering more and more prints, and orders are getting larger too, the market for films declined by 8 % last year. Companies and dealers have virtually stopped advertising for photos from films. Hence CeWe Color too has reported a decline in film developments of 5.2 %, to 89.4 million. Conventional prints from films have decreased by 3.7 % to 3,232 million. Decline in turnover of 5.2 % - In 2003 CeWe Color generated turnover amounting to Euro 416.2 million (2002: Euro 439.2 million). Our own retail branches in Scandinavia and Central Eastern Europe account for 12 % of this decline. In 2003, 24 unprofitable branches were closed down. A decline in turnover of Euro 6.1 million resulted from exchange-rate losses in Switzerland, Scandinavia and Central Eastern Europe. The remaining declines in turnover are due to shifts in the product mix in the area of conventional films and in particular to a weak tourism sector. Around 50 % of all photos ordered are taken during holiday trips. 2004 outlook - At present it is not clear how the tourism sector, so vital for the volume of prints, will develop during the summer season, and nor is it possible at the moment to asses by how much film developments will decline. The Board of Management of CeWe Color Holding AG therefore reports on its forecasts for 2004 within the following ranges: - Development in volume conventional - 8 % to - 15 % digital +150 % to +200 % total +/- 0 % to - 7 % - Sales +/- 0 % to - 7 % - Profits Cash Flow Euro 40 to Euro 50 million EBT Euro 10 to Euro 18 million - Investments Euro 30 to Euro 35 million - Dividends Euro 0.70 to Euro 0.90 Should you have any queries please contact: CeWe Color Holding AG, Hella Meyer, Tel.: 0441 / 404 - 400 or 0171 / 34 50 530, Fax: 0441 / 404 - 421, eMail: hella.meyer@cewecolor.de, Internet: http://www.cewecolor.de end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 02.03.2004\",\n",

After stable sales and improved earnings in the first three quarters of 2003 the fourth quarter turned out to be considerably worse than could have been predicted last November. Sales revenues were at around EUR39 million, a slight increase over the previous year (EUR37.8 million). In accordance with US GAAP rules, sales accounted for by the Plasma Systems Division (formerly TePla AG) were reported only for the last two months of 2002, given that the merger with PVA Vakuum-Anlagenbau GmbH took place in November of that year. On an annual basis (pro forma) revenues for the previous year would have been EUR46.7 million. Gross profits improved significantly in 2003. There was an increase in gross margin from around 19% in the previous year to more than 25%. Lower-than-expected revenues resulting from continued investor restraint and a strong euro compared to the dollar, particularly in the group\\'s semiconductor- related Plasma Systems and Crystal-Growing Systems Divisions, as well as further restructuring costs amounting to around EUR1 million pushed the net profit figure down. The preliminary result from ordinary activities reported for fiscal year 2003 is EUR-5.7 million (previous year EUR-5.0 million, pro forma EUR-9.5 million). The net loss for the year is expected to be around EUR3 million (previous year EUR-3.7 million, pro forma EUR-8.0 million). The group booked incoming orders in the amount of EUR38 million. The backlog of orders after deduction of sales revenues calculated in accordance with the \"percentage-of-completion method\" totalled EUR11 million, the same level reported at the end of the third quarter. Publication of the complete and audited Annual Report for 2003 will be on March 31, 2004 as planned. Based on a decision taken at the end of 2002 to carry out restructuring measures the Board of Directors began making personnel and capacity adjustments that brought about initial cost reductions in 2003. Further measures affecting the Crystal Growing Systems and the Plasma Systems Divisions in particular, and which it was not possible to undertake until fiscal 2004, should make it possible to move back past the operational break-even point as planned, barring instability in the global economy and the dollar exchange rate',\n",

According to preliminary figures SDAX quoted GERICOM AG reached revenues of about 445 mio EUR in 2003 (prev.: 544.07 mio EUR) and thus did not accomplish the target of 460 to 490 mio EUR. The reason for this was largely against the background of the week economic environment unfruitful Christmas trades in the core market Germany. Successful campaigns in the European area and a good start of the product pipeline in Home Entertainment (DVD Players, LCD-TV and Plasma-TV) could only compensate this partially. High volatility in the development of the US Dollar led to high losses in currency hedging and necessary financial depreciation of the inventory, which is valued in US Dollar, by the end of the year. Furthermore against the industry forecasts week Christmas trades led to increased inventory levels with contract partners and resulted in order cancellations and further shortfall of revenues. These circumstances burdened the results of operations and caused an EBIT of about -21 mio EUR (prev.: +23.79 mio EUR).

The Company substantially increased its market share in Germany from 6.8 to 10.7 percent. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) decreased to around EUR 13 million, with a sharp drop in margins being recorded in the last quarter in particular. REpower therefore did not achieve its original earnings targets. In comparison with 2002, the result also reflects an increase in expenditure for international business development and the successful launch of the 2-megawatt MM series, as well as the development of the REpower 5M 5-megawatt turbine. Earnings per share are expected to amount to EUR 1.20. In view of this situation and the prospects for 2004, the Company will be proposing an unchanged dividend of EUR 0.60. The Managing Board is confident about fiscal year 2004. International business will more than offset the decline expected in Germany. Advance payments have already been made on more than half of the 50 turbines earmarked for international customers in 2004, and some of these projects are already under construction. In Germany, the subsidiary Denker & Wulf AG sold 41 wind turbines to a fund initiator (a subsidiary of a German bank) in December last year, with a commitment to supply around 50 more turbines this year. REpower's order books remain well filled both in Germany and abroad.

       " 'COMPUTERLINKS reports strong performance in 2003 COMPUTERLINKS AG had a very successful end to the year 2003 resulting in Group turnover of 176.0 million Euro, an increase of 6.2% (165.8 million in the same period last year). Based on the same exchange rate (GBP/Euro) as in the previous year, group turnover in 2003 would have reached 182.8 million Euro (+ 10.3%). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased to 11.0 million Euro compared to 10.2 million Euro last year (+7.9%). Adjusted to take account of the change in exchange rate (GBP/Euro) EBITDA would have been 11.4 million Euro. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) showed a profit of 9.4 million Euro in 2003 after a loss of -71.0 million Euro in 2002. The net income for the year 2003 was 5.8 million Euro (previous year: -74.4 million Euro). Earnings per share stood at 0.98 Euro (previous year: -12.70 Euro). The strong, sustained movement in cash flow produced cash and cash equivalents of 16.1 million Euro at the end of 2003 (31st December 2002: 11.1 million Euro). By contrast there are no bank loans or overdrafts. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board are proposing to the General Meeting that a dividend of 0.34 Euro per share be distributed for 2003. This will result in an outflow of cash funds of 2 million Euro in 2004. The breakdown of group turnover by country is as follows: 78.0 million Euro were produced in Germany, 67.6 million Euro in the UK, 14.2 million Euro in France, 13.8 million Euro in Switzerland and 2.4 million Euro in Italy. As in the previous year the e-security division was the most important growth engine, which in a year-on-year comparison increased by 16.5% from 115.6 million Euro to 134.6 million Euro in 2003 and therefore contributed 76.5% to sales revenues. Gross profit was 33.6 million Euro in 2003, compared to 34.0 million Euro in 2002. Gross margins declined from 20.5% in 2002 to 19.1% in 2003 in particular as a result of larger projects concluded in the fourth quarter with lower margins on average.

On a comparable basis, i.e. without the contribution to sales of the shareholding in Harry\\'s, which was sold on September 30, 2003, the Group recorded net sales of EUR 1,486.8 million (2002: EUR 1,479.7 million). Including the nine months of Harry\\'s sales for 2003, Group net sales in 2003 totalled EUR 1,679.6 million (2002: EUR 1,728.8 million). The net loss for the year was cut to EUR 33.3 million from EUR 126.8 million in 2002. The sale of its shareholding in Harry\\'s for EUR 300 million enabled Kamps AG to completely repay its bank loans and reduce its gross debt to EUR 578.7 million (2002: 841.5 million) now mainly consisting of bonds. Thanks to this move, Kamps has regained the financial flexibility it needs to implement the Group\\'s transformation programme which was presented in November 2003 and which includes investments of up to EUR 300 million in the next few years. As a reaction to Kamps\\' reduced debt, the rating agency Fitch changed in February 2004 the BB credit rating\\'s outlook to \"positive\". This year\\'s press conference for the 2003 results will be held on April 27th, 2004. Business governed by consumers\\' price awareness The fall in consumer spending in 2003 impacted on the company\\'s sales structure and margins as demand shifted to retail bakery goods and discount articles. On a comparable basis Kamps Retail Bakeries increased sales by 2% to EUR 1,219.0 million (2002: EUR 1,195.5 million). Sales of the Kamps Bakeries reached EUR 246.7 million (2002: EUR 264.4 million) in Germany and the Netherlands with traditional craft bakery goods. The segment Others provided sales of EUR 21.1 million (2002: EUR 19.8 million). Sharp improvement in results In the absence of special balance-sheet clean-up expenses which were incurred in 2002 and thanks to strict cost management, EBIT increased substantially to EUR 52.8 million in 2003 (2002: EUR 22.2 million). Interest expenses were also well down thanks to better financing conditions. Overall, the Kamps Group managed to slash its net loss from EUR 126.8 million in 2002 to EUR 33.3 million. Systematically implementing transformation process Kamps anticipates no fundamental change in market trends in 2004 and will be concentrating on implementing the transformation projects. Revitalisation of the Golden Toast and Lieken Urkorn brands has been initiated. Lieken Urkorn has already been relaunched with the new-look products on the supermarket shelves since the beginning of the year. Initial investments to streamline and modernise the production infrastructure are planned so the company can counteract pressure on margins by increasing productivity. In the craft bakeries segment, Kamps is taking action on the selling side: The portfolio of locations is being optimised, the shops revamped and new ranges tested to make the bakeries more attractive. Company profile Kamps is the leading producer of bakery goods in Germany and the Netherlands.

According to provisional calculations, group sales reached EUR 210 m following EUR 191.6 m in 2002. Group earnings before income tax stand at EUR 10.6 which is well above the budget figure of EUR 8.3 m and on a par with the successful previous year (2002: EUR 10.8 m). The annual report for 2003 will be prepared for the first time in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards guidelines (IFRS). The growth in sales is based on the first-time consolidation of Westspreng GmbH Sprengstoff + Sprengtechnik which was taken over in the spring. Two negative factors in particular prevented the group from posting even better results. On the one hand, the sudden sharp rise in the cost of raw materials as a result of the crisis in Iraq led to negative results in the first quarter of 2003 for the division with the highest sales, namely Chemical Pharmaceutical Raw Materials. On the other, the weakness in the construction industry in the reporting period together with the extreme weather conditions (very long, cold winter, very dry summer) which did not favor the sale of sophisticated explosives, prevented higher contributions towards earnings being achieved in the market sector for stone and earth. Over the whole year, however, the group was almost able to offset these negative factors: the cost situation in the production of chemical pharmaceutical specialty products eased considerably as a result of the rapid implementation of individual measures and the end of the crisis in Iraq in the middle of the year. The other activities in explosives and the plastics division also proved to be pleasingly stable and resistant to economic forces. These outstanding results will enable the company to maintain its shareholder- friendly dividend policy initiated in the previous year. The Management Board will recommend to the Supervisory Board to disburse a dividend payment of EUR 0.30 per share. This will put the dividend on a par with the previous year's dividend once adjusted for the bonus of EUR 0.15.

At Euro 1.54 billion, EADS achieved an EBIT (pre-goodwill amortization and exceptionals) well above the previous target of about Euro 1.4 billion and up eight percent from 2002. EADS has beaten its EBIT forecast thanks to strong growth in its defence businesses and better than expected performance at Airbus. The EBIT improvement benefited from a 40 percent growth at the Defence and Security Systems Division with strong contributions from Military Aircraft and MBDA, the turnaround of the Military Transport Aircraft Division thanks to better performance and a 21 percent increase at the Aeronautics Division following increased profitability of Eurocopter. The Space Division recorded, in line with plan, an EBIT of Euro -400 million, after a restructuring charge of Euro 288 million. EBIT also includes a higher contribution from the 46.03 percent shareholding in Dassault Aviation. EADS Research and Development (R&D) expenditure increased, as planned, to Euro 2.2 billion in 2003 (2002: Euro 2.1 billion). Half of this was spent on R&D for the A380, the 555-seater Airbus aircraft due for first deliveries in 2006. Free Cash Flow before Customer Financing was strongly positive and was boosted from Euro 0.6 billion to Euro 2.1 billion thanks to better operating cash performance and working capital reductions due to higher customer advances. Net Income of Euro 152 million EADS achieved a positive Net Income in 2003 of Euro 152 million (2002: Euro -299 million). As a result of the original industrial integration of the EADS Group, goodwill amortization has been regularly recorded in the EADS accounts since the year 2000. Thanks to better EBIT, Net Income pre-goodwill amortization and exceptionals is up 10 percent to Euro 769 million (2002: Euro 696 million), or Euro 0.96 per share (2002: Euro 0.87). Outlook In anticipation of the legal requirement in the European Union to apply IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) rules strictly by 2005, EADS has changed its accounting policy regarding development costs to be fully compliant with IAS 38. Under this rule, costs that belong solely to the development phase of a project shall be capitalised as intangible assets, when certain conditions are met, while research costs are expensed in the Profit and Loss statement as incurred. The adoption of IAS 38 has no effect on the EADS Financial Statements as of 2003 and prior years. However, it is expected that approximately Euro 100 million of development costs will be capitalised in 2004. Consequently, EADS is increasing its EBIT forecast for 2004 to around Euro 1.8 billion from the previous guidance of Euro 1.7 billion. In 2004, EADS expects to continue generating a positive Free Cash Flow before Customer Financing. Indeed, the EADS management will continuously strive to offset the cash outlays from the A380 investment and the Skynet 5 construction by ongoing cash preservation initiatives. Maintaining its financial discipline, EADS also intends to pursue its control of commercial aviation customer financing with gross exposure expected not to increase by more than approximately USD 900 million. As was already announced, EADS expects 2004 revenues to remain stable, assuming an exchange rate of Euro 1 = USD 1.20. Airbus expects close to 300 aircraft deliveries in 2004. Regarding commercial activity, EADS expects to maintain a level of order intake above the level of revenues. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 08.03.2004\",\n",

Despite tough competitive conditions in 2003, vehicle deliveries once again topped the 5 million mark, and the Group slightly increased its world market share. Sales revenue totalled 87.2 (2002: 86.9) billion Euro. However, this success was not reflected satisfactorily in earnings development, which was instead hit by negative effects such as the strong Euro, weak economic conditions and the resulting pressure on margins. Volkswagen must take note that there are no signs of economic recovery yet. The whole automobile industry is exposed to the strains of the markets and high exchange rates. The Volkswagen Group is responding to these developments with the \"ForMotion\" program of measures. With \"ForMotion\", the Volkswagen Group is doubling its efforts to safeguard earnings and intends to achieve additional savings of some 2 billion Euro by the end of 2005. Savings already planned for the same period also total 2 billion Euro. The minimum goal is to achieve a balanced cash flow in 2004. Automobile markets have started the year very weak. That was especially true for January, while February has shown slight signs of improvement. Even though the Volkswagen Group has gone against the trend in this period and increased its market share during this period, the first quarter will be \"lousy\", even compared with last year. In view of the growing price pressure, the weak economy and the unfavourable exchange rates it is an ambitious goal for the Group to aim at topping the operating profit before special items of some 2.5 billion Euro from the previous year in 2004. \"ForMotion\" will provide vital support. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 09.03.2004',\n",

The operating EBIT for the AG is EUR 119 million against minus EUR 111 million in the previous year. This represents an improvement in operating EBIT of EUR 230 million. The result of ordinary operations before taking into account non- recurring effects is EUR 101 million for the AG, against minus EUR 107 million yoy. The result of ordinary operations taking into account non-recurring effects is minus EUR 240 million compared to minus EUR 621 million in the previous year. The same data for the WCM Group are as follows: operating EBIT EUR 171 million against minus EUR 150 million yoy. This represents an improvement of EUR 321 million. The result of ordinary operations before non-recurring effects is EUR 54 million against minus EUR 279 million yoy. The result of ordinary operations taking into account non-recurring effects is minus EUR 286 million against minus EUR 828 million yoy. The corresponding non-recurring effects mainly derive from the deconsolidation of GEHAG GmbH as at 31 December 2003 and the reduction of risk positions in connection with SIRIUS/IVG. Both the deconsolidation of GEHAG and the expenses for the adjustment of the SIRIUS/IVG commitment had no significant impact on liquidity. As at 31 December 2003, equity totalled EUR 270,8 million for the AG and EUR 304,4 million for the Group.

EBITDA 4,178 4,734 -11.7 EBITDA adjusted to exclude 4,503 4,354 3.4 special factors Deutsche Telekom increased its net revenue - according to preliminary figures for the 2003 fiscal year - by 4 percent year-on-year to EUR 55.8 billion. With adjusted EBITDA of EUR 18.3 billion, Deutsche Telekom exceeded its target by far. This represents growth of 12.1 percent and reflects the efficiency improvements the Group has made on its path towards profitable growth. Group EBITDA for the full 2003 financial year amounted to EUR 18.5 billion. Special factors impacting EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2003 amounting to negative EUR 0.3 billion relate mainly to personnel accruals. The Group's adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 32.8 percent compared with 30.4 percent for the full 2002 financial year. All divisions contributed to this increase. Deutsche Telekom achieved the turnaround with net income of EUR 1.3 billion, after recording a net loss of EUR 24.6 billion in 2002. Adjusted net income totaled EUR 0.2 billion compared with a loss of EUR 4.8 billion in 2002. Net income decreased in the fourth quarter of the year, mainly due to the burden of the Toll Collect project, amounting to EUR 442 million. The provision for risks included in this figure means that, from the current perspective, all foreseeable risks are covered. Despite these negative effects, Deutsche Telekom achieved its net income target for the full financial year, both in absolute and adjusted figures. Net debt was reduced further in the fourth quarter of 2003 by EUR 2.6 billion to EUR 46.6 billion at the end of the year. This means net debt has decreased by a total of EUR 17.7 billion since the strategic review in 2002. This achievement is attributable to the sale of noncore assets totaling EUR 6.7 billion, as well as to the continued progress made in increasing profitability and sustained growth in key areas of the Group. With free cash flow before dividend of EUR 8.3 billion in 2003 and EUR 8.5 billion since the strategic review in the third quarter of 2002, Deutsche Telekom exceeded its target of generating free cash flow of more than EUR 6 billion by the end of 2003 by a clear margin of over EUR 2 billion. The focus in the 2004 financial year is on profitable growth. Deutsche Telekom is aiming to generate adjusted Group EBITDA of at least EUR 19.2 billion. The use of free cash flow will depend on the opportunities that arise: to further reduce debt and to increase investments. The possibility of selective acquisitions has not been ruled out, provided they offer an opportunity to further increase the value of the Group. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to this year's shareholders' meeting that no dividend be paid. The Board of Management plans, however, to generate a dividend in 2004 for payment in 2005.

According to preliminary figures, net income increased 8 % to EUR 90 million. Consolidated sales rose by 4.3 % to EUR 1,320 million. At EUR 136 million, operating profit was slightly above the previous year's level. These improvements mainly resulted from the first full- year consolidation of the 2002 acquisitions. The effective Group corporate tax rate decreased from approximately 37 % to 30 %. This reduction resulted from an optimization of the company structure within the Mayr-Melnhof Group and the utilization of tax loss carry forwards. Outlook High capacity utilization since the beginning of this year might affirm a sustainable improvement in demand if this trend continues into the second quarter. In this case, pricing pressure still prevailing in the European cartonboard and folding carton industries could slow down. The situation in the non-European cartonboard markets will remain highly competitive. Programs to improve cost efficiency will, therefore, constitute a prime focus also in 2004 within the whole MM-Group. The recovered paper markets already reflect the positive trend in demand, as no more exceptional price reductions are granted as they were in the previous year. Due to the current lack of visibility, initial estimates for the current year seem possible during the second quarter at the earliest.

The third- biggest primary insurance group in Germany reached a consolidated net income of EUR 48 m, after tax and before extraordinary items, for the business year 2003. New taxation rules for life and health insurers led to an extraordinary item of EUR 41 m affecting the 2003 Group result.

The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to the General Meeting to be held on May 19 in Aachen to distribute a dividend at the preceding year\\'s level of EUR 1.35 per share. On the basis of the consistently implemented structural measures and persistent cost discipline, the Group anticipates a noticeable growth in operative business for the current business year. Provided there are no extraordinary claims or negative capital-market developments, the AMB Generali Group expects to reach a net income after tax of at least EUR 200 m in 2004.

In life insurance, the Group posted an increase of 3.3 percent of its business in regular premiums to which priority is conceded in underwriting.

Daewoong will exclusively market Foscan(R) in South Korea. The sales agreement with the Daewoong is a further indication of the international appeal of Foscan(R) and marks the continued penetration of Foscan into the Asian market. This follows the signing of a previous sales agreement with a Taiwanese distributor in July last year. Daewoong has annual sales of about US$250 million and is the number two ethical pharmaceuticals company in Korea by sales revenue. This sales agreement serves as a vote of confidence in the efficacy and market potential of Foscan(R). Daewoong will also be an important reference customer for the Asian market. The contract has ten year validity with an auto-renewal clause. With the signing of the contract, Daewoong has also purchased 200 vials of Foscan for use in the first year following marketing regulatory approval.

At a constant US dollar rate total revenue for 2003 would have been EUR 334 million, which is an increase of 11%. At a constant US dollar rate each of the three regions have been able to show revenue growth in 2003 (EMEA +13%; Americas +3%; APAC +52%). The termination of the major Pass Through contract during 2003 specifically impacts the revenue development of the Americas Region. Over the entire fiscal year 2003, Teleplan showed a negative EBITDA of EUR 8.6 million (2002: EUR 51.5 million), but in Q4 2003 Teleplan turned to a positive EBITDA of EUR 2.7 million (2002: EUR 16.9 million). Net income amounted to minus EUR 42.3 million in 2003 (2002: EUR 3.7 million). This significant loss figure is a result of impairment charges (EUR 20.7 million) and large restructuring activities. The goodwill impairment charge relates to site closures, termination of the Pass Through program and transfers of businesses to low labor cost areas. The total of these exceptional restructuring charges amounts to EUR 48.8 million, which are largely non-cash.

       " \"fluxx.com takes over Hamburg-based syndicates provider - Acquisition of DSM Lottoservice GmbH - Capital increase of 1.66 million shares through contributions in kind - Market position in syndicates segment strengthened On the basis of a capital increase through contributions in kind, the Kiel-based company fluxx.com Aktiengesellschaft (ISIN DE 0005763502), a leading service provider for the handling of lotteries and betting, is taking over DSM Lottoservice GmbH in an agreement backdated to January 1, 2004. This Hamburg company is a subsidiary of DSM Direct Sales Marketing GmbH, which has been acting as a sales company for lottery syndicates for slightly more than two years and is one of the key marketing partners of fluxx.com in this market segment. The number of syndicate contracts currently held by DSM Lottoservice GmbH, which has taken over the entire operations from its parent company, runs into five figures. DSM Direct Sales Marketing GmbH will be permitted to subscribe to and acquire the 1,660,000 new shares from the approved capital of fluxx.com Aktiengesellschaft. The issue price of the shares, which are not being admitted for trading, is EUR 2.88 and reflects the minimum price pursuant to Section 5 Para. 3 of the Offer Ordinance of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act prior to signing of the contribution agreement. The subscription right was excluded pursuant to Section 4 Para. 5 of the Articles of Incorporation. As a result of the capital change, the capital stock of fluxx.com Aktiengesellschaft rises from EUR 5,915,390 to EUR 7,575,390. The capital increase remains to be entered on the Commercial Register. The acquisition means that fluxx.com has substantially strengthened its position in the rapidly growing lottery syndicates market segment. The marketing of syndicate products is becoming increasingly important at fluxx.com alongside its core activity of handling lotteries and betting. In 2003, the fluxx.com Group's sales of such products quadrupled. DSM achieves one of the highest profit margins of any of fluxx.com's partners. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 12.03.2004\",\n",
       " 'IVU Traffic Technologies AG (WKN 744850) publishes annual report 2003 IVU\\'s revenues and EBIT weaker Earnings include high special effects Strong position in public transport market IVU Traffic Technologies AG earned roughly EUR 30 million in revenues, which is a sixteen percent drop over 2002. EBIT dropped from EUR 0.8 million to EUR (6.2) million, and the consolidated loss changed from EUR (3.5) million to EUR 7.4 million. The comparison of turnover and EBIT with figures from the previous year is distorted by some special effects. One of those one-time effects being that IVU was able to submit invoices worth EUR 5 million in 2002 for projects that had been delayed and could not be billed until that year. As a result, the company earned roughly the same revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003. In addition, substantial extraordinary gains were derived from the sale of companies and release of reserves in 2002, which made the 2002 results look better. The comparison of EBIT is also distorted by much fewer activated performances on own account in 2003 than in 2002. The total of all these effects is EUR 5.8 million, influencing earnings in 2003 negatively. \"We expected the 2003 business year to turn out better, and are not happy with this result\", said IVU CEO Prof. Dr. Ernst Denert in Berlin. \"However, we have used this difficult year to substantially lower costs and to emerge as a stronger company, especially where sales are concerned. I am therefore optimistic about 2004,\" Denert continued. IVU expects 2004 revenues to exceed EUR 30 million at heavily reduced costs. After the company laid off fifty employees in the spring of 2003, personnel costs dropped over EUR 2 million during the course of the year. Other costs were also further reduced. In addition the high extraordinary depreciations negatively influencing earnings will revert to a normal level until 2007, which is appropriate for the levels of new investments. A contribution will be made in particular by the fact that we will no longer activate performances made on own account. In the past years, high performances on own account were activated in particular in the development of our software platform for public transport. These investments are now beginning to pay off, and the systems are proving successful on the market. IVU is the only system developer to offer customers an IT platform for all public transport requirements. In 2003 the company further improved its market position in this business. The Management Board be-lieves that the significant structural changes facing the public transport business over the next few years will create an outstanding market environment for software suppliers. Dr. Gero Scholz, an excellent IT expert, joined the Management Board, taking on the responsibility of boosting efficiency in software development and further improving the systems. The company plans to increase revenues by strengthening its sales organisation in Germany and - most importantly - abroad. In fact, IVU\\'s existing foreign subsidiaries cover a territory that is twice the size of the German-speaking countries combined, although they have con-tributed less than ten percent of revenues to date. The transport industry, for which IVU supplies fleet logistics systems, is already showing noticeable signs of an economic recovery. In all probability, more than half the equity capital we have been used up by the end of the first quarter of 2004. In view of our conservative planning it is anticipated that this will also be the case until the end of the financial year 2004. This will be explained to the General Meeting held on 2 June 2004. Special capital measures are not planned; the equity capital situa-tion should be improved sufficiently by good economies. The complete annual report can be found at http://www.ivu.de',\n",
       " \"Wolford materially exceeds prior-year earnings Positive sales momentum subdued in January Earnings before tax (EBT) up 50 percent Financials improved from previous year First three quarters Change In millions of euros 2003/04 2002/03 in % except per- share data Sales 90.55 98.84 - 8.4% EBITDA 7.76 8.43 - 8.0% EBITDA margin 8.6 % 8.5 % EBIT 2.74 2.57 + 7.0% EBIT margin 3.0 % 2.6 % Financial result (1.14) (1.50) + 24.1% EBT 1.61 1.07 + 50.7% Net profit for the period 1.71 0.65 + 163.1% Cashflow from operating activities 10.59 10.30 + 2.8% Earnings per share in euros 0.36 0.14 + 163.1% From May 2003 to January 2004, despite a decrease in revenues, Wolford increased earnings before taxes (EBT) by 50 percent. As well, nine months into the current fiscal year, the company passed the corresponding 2002/03 results in the other key financial figures. Until into the Christmas shopping season the Wolford Group registered positive sales momentum that further cushioned the significant decreases witnessed earlier in the fiscal year. However, this trend gave way to a subdued pattern in January. The fall/winter end-of-season sales did not meet expectations and the until then significant positive impetus from prompt orders was absent in January. On balance, revenues in the first three quarters of fiscal 2003/04 were EUR 90.6 million compared to EUR 98.8 million in the year-earlier period, a reduction of 8.4 percent as measured in the Group's reporting currency. Almost half (4.0 percentage points) of the sales contraction was attributable to exchange rate movements and about one-quarter (2.2 percentage points) represented the sales of unprofitable Wolford-owned outlets that were closed down. Meanwhile, new store openings included, among others, four new locations operated by the new distribution partner in the Far East and one boutique each in Kiev and St. Petersburg. Earnings The trend in the specific financials proves that Wolford extended the positive earnings trend of the first two quarters and has reliably restored its financial strength. The third quarter brought net profit for the fiscal year to date to EUR 1.7 million. This figure was reached despite a EUR 8 million reduction in sales, and was more than EUR 1 million higher than the earnings of the year- earlier period. The result corresponds to earnings per share of EUR 0.36 for the first three quarters, compared to EUR 0.14 per share in the first nine months of fiscal 2002/03. Operating profit (EBIT) was pushed up by 7.0 percent to EUR 2.7 million. Earnings before tax improved by 50.7 percent to EUR 1.6 million. The upward jump in earnings, which began in the first half of the year, resulted from the further optimization of the cost structure. Staff costs fell by EUR 3.3 million compared to the first nine months of the previous year. This and the further reduction in other operating expenses (down EUR 1.7 million) led to an improvement in operating profit. Cash flow from operating activities rose by EUR 0.3 million to EUR 10.6 million, corresponding to an increase of 11.7 percent in the cash flow to sales ratio. The financial result improved further by EUR 0.4 million to EUR - 1.1 million. Net debt fell from EUR 40.2 million to EUR 25.7 million and the debt-equity gearing improved from 64.6 percent twelve months earlier to 38.8 percent. Wolford is thus approaching its medium-term target of reducing the gearing to 30 percent. The equity ratio rose from 41.7 percent to 47.9 percent. Business outlook The share of the prompt-order business (short-term orders for immediate delivery) in total revenues continues to grow steadily. This coupled with the uncertainty of future exchange rate movements (especially in the U.S. dollar) makes it difficult to arrive at exact sales forecasts for the full year. In all of the company's activities, the management's top priority is to expand business volume and partly offset the first three quarters' sales decline by the end of the fiscal year\",\n",
       " \"One time balance sheet adjustment influenced consolidated annual result, lays foundation for turnaround in 2004 Restructuring expenditure in line with plan After final completion of restructuring, the Management Board has undertaken a review of the entire investment portfolio as part of drawing up the consolidated annual financial statements to 31 December 2003. As a result of the adjustment, extraordinary depreciations of consolidated goodwill totaling EUR 10.1 million were agreed. They will have no effect on liquidity. Along with scheduled restructuring expenditure, especially settlements and the heavy interest expences of bank loans repaid in full at the end of December 2003, the consolidated annual result for the year 2003 will be negative. Yet the operating result on sales of EUR 127.8 million is positive for the fourth quarter in succession. The equity ratio now stands at 24.5% (previous year: 26,4%), taking into account, along with the 26.6% reduction in liabilities, the EUR 4.6 million raised by the 31 December 2003 convertible bond issue and the bridging mortgage for the Jahrhunderthalle in Frankfurt that was taken out on the same date. As at 31 December 2003, the DEAG Group's gross liquidity was EUR 36.4 million. In the past few weeks the Management Board has been able to eliminate the liquidity risks outlined in the capital increase prospectus. Liquidity is now fully assured by a seven-digit tax refund, the granting of a current account credit line and the sale of the first plots of land adjoining the Jahrhunderthalle in Frankfurt am Main.

       " \"Revenue for the last half-year up 50% compared to the first half-year. Profit reduced because of a one-time reserve for bad debt. 3U looks back to a successful year 2003. The company continues to be profitable while continuing to expand through the opening of subsidiaries in Belgium and Luxemburg. With the takeover of OneTel, business in Germany was greatly reinforced, while setting the basic conditions for an expansion in 2004. The company's revenues for 2003 were 64.68 million Euros, 2% less than in 2002. During the last 2 quarters, revenues increased by 50% compared to the first 2 quarters, which compensated for the temporary reduction of the less lucrative wholesale business. The profits of the company for the operational business improved greatly. However, the yearly surplus from 2003 was affected by a one-time reserve of about 1.8 million Euros due to OneTel's bad debt before the takeover. Therefore, the net profit for 2003 did not increase by 50%, as had been internally forecasted, but remained at 1.73 million Euros, about the same amount than the 1.78 million Euros of profit in the previous year. Positive development expected in 2004! For the current fiscal year 2004, the officers confirmed their forcast of 100 million Euros of revenue and a profit of over 1.00 Euro per share. With the consolidation of OneTel through the entire fiscal year, the revenue will increase to over 80 million Euros. The internal growth will reach about 25%, which will be achieved through the redevelopment of the wholesale business, as well as through different measures planned for organic growth. The forcasted profit after taxes of 10 million Euros is based on a cost structure like the one 3U had before the takeover of OneTel in 2003, cost structure which will be reached again after the integration of OneTel is completed. Therefore the expected profit after taxes is about 10% of the revenue. On 12/31/2003, the company possessed liquid and near-liquid assets of about 55.5 million Euros, or about 6 Euros per share. In addition, the securities include silent reserves of about 4 million Euros.

The DAB bank Group, Munich (www.dab-bank.com), which operates in Germany and Austria, posted a pretax profit of EUR 13.4 million in 2003, the best result in its 10-year history. The turnaround, accomplished in less than twelve months, is all the more remarkable for the fact that the Group's stated goal had simply been to break even for the year. By raising its income and reducing its costs, DAB bank managed to increase its pretax profit by EUR 72.0 million (pro forma 2002: pretax loss of -EUR 58.7 million). The Group's total income rose EUR 25.0 million to reach EUR 132.7 million in 2003 (pro forma 2002: EUR 107.7 million). Net commission income increased by an impressive 25.9% to EUR 69.3 million (pro forma 2002: EUR 55.1 million). The higher net commission income also attests to the success of the Group's selling activities. Net interest income before provisions for possible losses came to EUR 42.4 million (pro forma 2002: EUR 32.4 million), substantially higher than the prior-year figure. Net financial income (sum of net interest income before provisions for possible losses, profit/loss from investments and trading profit/loss) increased 34.2% to EUR 31.4 million (pro forma 2002: EUR 23.4 million. Total expenses, composed of provisions for possible losses, commission expenses and administrative expenses, fell EUR 47.9 million to EUR 117.8 million (pro forma 2002: EUR 165.7 million). At EUR 94.5 million, the administrative expenses, which include depreciation of property, plant and equipment, were again reduced by 33.2% from the prior-year level (pro forma 2002: EUR 141.5 million). The cost-income ratio was cut nearly in half to 0.86 (2002 pro forma: 1.69). Earnings per share improved significantly to EUR 0.17 (2002 pro forma: -EUR 0.99). Return on equity was 10.4%. Customer assets under management grew substantially by 26.7% to EUR 11.88 billion (2002: EUR 9.38 billion), nearly reaching the record level of EUR 11.96 billion achieved in the boom year of 2000.

The acquisition will be financed through increasing Infineon's capital by 26,679,255 new shares through a capital increase in kind. Now that the contractual conditions allow Infineon to acquire the minority holdings and the 300mm facilities are fully operational Infineon will take sole control of SC300 KG. SC300 KG operates one of the world's most advanced semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities based on 300mm technology. Through the introduction of 300mm technology Infineon has been benefiting from increased productivity and achieved cost savings of approximately 30 percent. Infineon and the minority shareholders Leipziger Messe GmbH and SC 300 Beteiligungs GmbH in SC300 KG had agreed by the foundation of SC300 KG on advance profit participation which affected Infineon's Consolidated Financial Statements since the operations of SC 300 KG were already fully consolidated.

       " 'Major German TV station claims temporary injunction against Tivion Media Center Once again German major Broadcaster RTL (owned by Bertelsmann) tries to block unpleasant but consumer friendly technology and innovation with a temporary injunction. Once again a temporary injunction shall stop the TC Unterhaltungselektronik AG (TC consumer electronics AG). Historic background: Major German TV networks tried to stop judicial the worldwide unique \"Commercial Blocking System\" four years ago. But all were defeated by appellate court in Berlin. Now the highest German Court (BGH) will decide at 24th June of 2004. This was not mentioned by RTL attorneys in their newest urgent request for a temporary injunction. TC is convinced, that it will stay legal to automate what can be done by hand: to zap away during a TV commercial What about the new temporary injunction? In order to make the system affordable for anyone, the set top box was redesigned as free PC software (Freeware). Nationwide signal broadcasting was changed into an internet server. The Freeware was copied more than 180.000 times in the first four month of release (www.download.tivion.de). Leading German press \"Die Zeit\" said \"Tivion, on of three companies, which can change future tv market\" (Tivo, Replay, Tivion) and Tivion was one of the CeBIT-Highlights. In many press releases TC described the massive strategic implications of technology like Tivion. TC described clearly and urgently, how technology like Tivion can and will change media conditions worldwide. Even members of RTL-New- Media (technology branch of RTL) visited the TC booth on CeBIT for hours of detailed information. But now RTL declares that the first contact with Tivion was a letter from BMG Music Group. (BMG invited TC for a presentation of strategic investment, but TC was not interested). Both companies are members of Bertelsmann Media Group. How could Tivion change the worldwide TV market? Tivion could replace any TV-commercial spot with own multimedia content, theoretical with own commercials. Video-capturing is done commercial free, saving disk space and user-time. But even real time TV experience is commercial free (zap away, zap back) which is a worldwide unique feature and can protect Childs from unwanted material. It maybe a special annoyance for RTL, that Tivion is Freeware (www.download.tivion.de ), but this is not relevant for a juristically point of view. RTL declares that TC replaces RTL commercials with own commercials. This is not true and wouldn\\'t make sense for the high end users of Tivion. Stupid commercial breaks are boring and not efficient, compared to the much more sophisticated advertising chances of Tivion. Tivion combines deep impact of TV with direct interactive response of web-ads and allows very intelligent and accepted ways of advertising. It was developed together with advertising industries and fulfils the newest needs of advertising as well as users right of privacy and self- determination. Tivion User are similar to TiVo User and want save time instead of wasting time. This is one of the reasons for the huge demand of those more specific ways of advertising. Another reason is the well known lack of iTV in Germany. Alternatives like MHP or Open-TV need the cooperation of TV-broadcasters and set top box industry, which has shown as a construction fault. Media Dinosaur like RTL or BMG had have enough time to adjust their long term strategies to the facts of internet culture. Here we have File sharing-systems, free music transfer and broadband-pay-tv sharing (a new Tivion project). Tivion is just a platform for those techniques, making these expert techniques available to all TV spectators with just a click on the remote control. Our company, the TC Unterhaltungselektronik AG has warned drastically more than one time, that Tivion may have massive & fundamental implications to mass media TV. Maybe not today, but sure for tomorrow. The potential of Tivion is very high. Broadcasters, which won\\'t believe that TC is able to realize such a project, are now fully responsible for their false estimation. Even the former RTL CEO - Helmut Thoma - already knew in 2001: \"The differences between TV and PC disappear with the time. If the quality is correct, it will not matter, who supplies the pictures...\". For TC, there will be NO restrictions in selling, in income, or with distribution of Tivion software. All relevant success indicators point steeply upward for months and are expected to grow more rapidly. At 10th March 2004 TC released the first English version of the software, further increase is expected. The executive committee of the TC consumer electronics AG finds their media strategies confirmed and expects more than ever an positive development of Tivion. TC is open for new investors, especially strategic partners, beyond stock exchange opportunities.

The specialist for high-performance plastic components generated revenues amounting to 272.9 million euros, an increase of 37.6 percent. Thanks to an unexpectedly strong fourth quarter, the Group even surpassed its forecast which it had revised upwards last October to 255 to 260 million euros. The key growth driver was the Infocom division with its production sites in Germany and Asia. As a system partner of cell-phone manufacturers, Balda sharply expanded its global market share from 10 percent to 13 percent in 2003. Operating results (EBIT) improved 97.4 percent, to 28.9 million euros (previous year: 14.6 million euros). The EBIT margin increased significantly, from 7.1 percent to 10.1 percent. At 22.8 million euros, earnings before taxes (EBT) were 140.7 percent higher than in the year before and 34 percent above the revised forecast. Net income for the year was one and a half times as much, climbing from 4.6 million euros to 11.6 million euros. Balda realised earnings per share (EPS) amounting to 0.308 euros in fiscal 2003, a plus of 124.8 percent. EPS had stood at 0.137 euros the year before. In addition, Balda improved its financial position and net worth considerably through a series of capital measures in 2003. Shareholders' equity grew 42 percent, to 104.4 million euros (previous year: 73.3 million euros); at 43.8 percent, the equity ratio was significantly above last year's ratio of 35.6 percent. The net gearing ratio - the ratio of net financial liabilities to shareholders' equity - improved considerably, from 115.4 percent to 33.5 percent. The Supervisory Board and the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of 0.10 euros per share at the annual general meeting on 29th April 2004, which means that the payout to Balda shareholders will be twice as much as in the year before. Following the capital increase in 2003, the number of shares entitled to dividend climbed to 37.53 million, after 33.72 million shares the year before. The Board of Directors is forecasting that 2004 will see revenues grow organically by some 15 to 17 percent to reach 315 to 320 million euros. EBT is projected to be between 27 and 28 million euros, representing an increase of 18 to 23 percent over 2003. EPS is expected to increase 46 to 53 percent this year, from 0.45 to 0.47 euros. This would mark yet another year in which Balda grew faster than its core market - the mobile-phone industry (a plus of 10 to 15 percent). The infocom sector is projected to contribute some 86 percent to the Group's revenues in 2004. Balda is expecting extraordinarily high increases in revenues, particularly in the growth markets where the Asian production sites are located.

Our operating result (EBITDA) increased by EUR 224 million to EUR 493 million. Net income rose to EUR 249 million after a loss of EUR 128 million in the previous year. In particular, also through the asset sales of Anneliese Zementwerke and Cementos Hispania we reduced our net debt by EUR 449 million to EUR 581 million (EUR 785 million including the mezzanine financing). Thereby our Gearing improved to 55 %. In our operational business - without consideration of the capital gains of EUR 219 million from the asset disposals - we managed to achieve the turnaround via our \"Dyckerhoff 21\" restructuring project within only one year. We were able to largely compensate the impact on earnings from the continuing deterioration of revenues in Germany in 2003. Our operating result increased by EUR 5 million to EUR 274 million and, at EUR 30 million, we have generated a positive Group net profit from our operational business again. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, therefore, will propose to distribute a dividend of EUR 0.26 for the preferred shares to the Annual General Meeting on May 12, 2004. The payment of the primary portion of the dividend in the amount of EUR 0.13 is allocated to the preferential dividend not payed out for the fiscal year 2002.

       " \"Restructuring completed Firm foundation for sustainable future growth DEAG Deutsche Entertainment AG (SIN 551390, ISIN DE0005513907) rang up EUR 127.9 million in sales last financial year, equivalent to 27,6% sales growth compared with the previous year's EUR 100.2 million after adjustment for changes in the consolidation entity. EBITDA improved by EUR 3.2 million to EUR 8.8 million (2002: EUR 5.6 million). EBIT, after restructuring costs and before extraordinary depreciations, was at EUR 4.5 million in FY 2003 well above the previous year's EUR 1.2 million. Due to scheduled repayment of bank loans, settlements agreed to resolve litigation risks extraordinary expenses were taken into account and leads to a negative consolidated net loss of EUR 14.7 million. The equity ratio of 26.4% is unchanged compared to prior year. As at 31 December 2003, the DEAG Group's gross liquid assets totaled EUR 36.4 million, plus EUR 1.1 million in securities. Adjusted for advance payments of EUR 21.6 million for upcoming events, net liquid assets were EUR 15,9 million (2002: EUR 4.8 million). Additional liquidity from tax refunds within the first quarter 2004 and a loan are not taken into account. Furthermore, DEAG expected additional cash inflow from the sale of the first part of Jahrhunderthalle Frank-furt, independently from the public presentation of development plan. DEAG is acquiring on 31 March 2004 a 50% holding in Auric Entertainment GmbH, Düsseldorf. Under Gerald Wagener's management, this company will bundle business activities in connection with the Düsseldorf Rheinarena, sporting events and the development of an event management agency in Russia. DEAG Supervisory Board member Gerald Wagener, who owns the remaining 50% of the company via Auric GmbH & Co. KG, has given a personal undertaking to work full-time as the company's managing director until 2007. As a result of this directorship he is resign-ing from the Supervisory Board with effect from the date on which the holding is acquired in accordance with § 100 (2) No. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Advance bookings for concerts and tours with Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Cher, Pink, Eros Ramazzotti, Elton John, Udo Jürgens, Peter Maffay's Tabaluga, Stray Cats, Black Eyed Peas, Lemar, Katie Malua, the Berlinova and the Sugababes are running extremely successfully. The Management Board is convinced that with the completion of restructuring, a lastingly streamlined structure and organic growth prospects in Germany and elsewhere, it has laid a firm foundation for positive development by DEAG.

In the 2003 financial year RATIONAL AG (ISIN: DE0007010803, WKN 701080), which manufactures combi-steamers for professional kitchens, once again continued its course of high-yielding growth. EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) rose 11% from EUR38.2 million to a record EUR42.3 million. This is equivalent to a gross profit-sales ratio of 22.7% in 2003 (21.5% in 2002). Subject to the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting a cash dividend of EUR1.85 (previous year: EUR1.30) per share will be distributed for 2003. This figure includes an anniversary bonus of EUR0.45 per share to mark the company's 30th anniversary. Despite a significantly higher tax ratio (37.1% in 2003, 30.6% in 2002), this year's annual net profits were EUR26.8 million, compared to EUR26.6 million the previous year. A 9% increase in sales meant RATIONAL once more grew faster than average, and so managed to expand its global market share from 47% to 49%. Due to the strength of the euro against the US dollar, the pound sterling and the Japanese yen sales revenue in 2003 rose by 5% from EUR177.3 million to EUR186.6 million. For 2004 the company expects to see a moderate upturn in the global economy overall, with a correspondingly positive effect on the development of the business. The main emphasis in 2004 is therefore on expanding the global sales and marketing network. To date only 20% of the 2.5 million suitable kitchens around the world have switched to modern combi-steamer technology. Against this backdrop management is optimistic of seeing a double-digit increase in sales and earnings in 2004\",\n",

In the 2003 financial year, the KarstadtQuelle Group was impacted by continuing consumer restraint in Germany, but held its ground in a difficult market environment. The 10-Step Value Enhancement Program was implemented and concluded. The transformation to a retail and services group is gradually taking form. Group sales of EUR15.3 billion were achieved, down 3.4% year-on-year. Sales development was stable in the first half of the year, but disappointing in the second half of 2003. The key factors here were consumer uncertainty in the context of the ongoing discussion on reforms and aggressive price competition in Christmas business. The Over-the-counter retail segment (department and speciality stores) in German city centres was again hit hard by consumer restraint. Mail order business did not match the record sales of Quelle's anniversary year 2002, and also posted a sales downturn in the reporting year. The new segments, Services and Real estate, continued to develop well. Earnings before tax and amortization on goodwill (EBTA) amounted to EUR225 million after EUR294 million in the previous year. Negative factors contributing to this included the consumer slump in Germany, but also the crisis in the tourism market. Earnings pressure relating to the poor state of the economy was reduced by a large number of marketing measures combined with optimisation of product range and costs. In the reporting year, earnings were lifted by non- recurring effects, as was the case in the previous year. Adjusted for these non- recurring effects, a positive EBTA was achieved. The net profit after minorities declined to EUR108 million (after EUR162 million in the previous year). Earnings per share were EUR1.01 (PY: EUR1.40) Continuity is the watchword of the dividend policy at KarstadtQuelle AG. For this reason the KarstadtQuelle AG Management and Supervisory Boards propose to the Annual General Meeting which takes place on May 4, 2004 in Dusseldorf to pay an unchanged divided of EUR0.71 per share. The distribution volume (to third parties) is EUR75.5 million. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board approved the establishment of a joint venture with REWE Handelsgesellschaft to operate food areas in Karstadt department stores. The Management Board will provide further information and comments on the 2003 financial statements at the Annual Press Conference and Analysts' Conference in Dusseldorf on March 23, 2004.

       " 'Clearly positive EBIT - net bank debt completely repaid In fiscal 2003, the Kleindienst Datentechnik Group generated revenues of EUR 68.6 million and operating income of EUR 4.4 million. Although revenues were down EUR 6.7 million on the previous year, operating income remained almost the same (previous year: EUR 4.6 million). With EBIT of EUR 4.2 million, the basic goal of the Company in 2003 - namely a clearly positive EBIT - has been achieved. Ongoing cost reduction activities have considerably contributed to this achievement. In 2003, consolidated earnings before taxes, minority interests and non- recurring income rose by more than 17% to EUR 3.3 million. However, at EUR 0.8 million, net income fell significantly as against the previous year (EUR 6.1 million) due to non-cash valuation effects (non-recurring income in 2002 and changes to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in 2002 and 2003). Net income per share (DVFA/SG) thus dropped to EUR 0.19 (previous year: EUR 0.78). Net bank debt, which had amounted to EUR 2.3 million at the end of 2002, have been reduced to zero. At the end of 2003 net bank balance was EUR 1.0 million. In 2003 total order value amounted to EUR 27.5 million (previous year: EUR 31.8 million), as of December 31, 2003 orders on hand were at EUR 8.5 million (previous year: EUR 10.5 million). This development is due to our unsatisfactory performance in international markets. An improvement of the situation is expected in 2004 as a result of the implementation of internal organizational measures. For the fiscal year 2004 the Managing Board expects consolidated revenues to rise and is forecasting clearly positive EBIT.

The company is regarded as the leading global supplier of surface technologies based on specialist papers and plastics for technical applications. While forecasts were corrected upwards in September, the actual results for the 4th quarter were even better than expected. The balance sheet for 2003 highlights this success in the results for ordinary activities before restructuring expenses, which are reported as Euro 29.7 million instead of the Euro 26 million forecast. The Group has thereby only slightly undershot the result for 2002 (Euro 30 million). SURTECO AG also succeeded in reducing the financial debts significantly by Euro 35 million to Euro 146 million; these debts are mainly related to acquisitions. SURTECO AG is structured in two strategic business units, SBU Paper and SBU Plastics. The Group generated consolidated sales amounting to Euro 355 million in 2003, which was 3 % below the amount for the previous year (Euro 367.6 million). However, after adjustment for currency losses, sales would only be Euro 0.5 million below the value for the previous year. The share of foreign sales in total sales remains relatively high at 60 % and underpins this perspective. EBIT for 2003 fell from Euro 42.7 to Euro 37.2. Net consolidated income for the year at Euro 14.9 million was Euro 2.7 million below the figure for the previous year. Shareholders of SURTECO AG should also participate in the net income of Euro 14.8 million. The Board of Management will propose a payout of a dividend amounting to Euro 0.70 per share at the Annual General Meeting (Munich, 17 June). SURTECO AG employed 1,937 employees at the end of the year and is assuming that its market scenarios will not change substantially in 2004. However, the company is optimistic that the current fiscal year will be concluded with figures that slightly exceed the figures for the previous year. The Group continues to anticipate stimuli abroad where opportunities for growth are perceived and these are also being actively promoted. For example, the 75% stake in Arbe s.r.l. near Venice acquired in December 2003 will significantly strengthen the sales structures of SURTECO AG in Italy.

A decisive factor was the decline of Initial's operative result from 25.5 million euros in 2002 to -7.1 million euros in the past fiscal year. This sale generates savings of at least 16.5 million euros for the Internationalmedia group. Equivalent payments would have become due to Initial and their shareholders in the near future. In addition to the aforementioned savings of at least 16.5 million euros, the Internationalmedia group retains film rights with an aggregate value of 4.0 million euros. Furthermore, the Internationalmedia group retains overages from the films TRAFFIC, GANGS OF NEW YORK, ALI and THE AVIATOR amounting to at least 11.5 million euros, implying a mid term positive impact on the free cash at hand of at least 32.0 million euros. The sale of Initial Entertainment Group, Inc. affects the balance sheet with a loss of 55.5 million euros. This result is mainly due to non-cash equity shifting within the past years. Included is a purchase price component of 21.7 million euros, which was paid in shares at a stock price of 20.25 euros, as well as the past years' earnings contributions from Initial of 8.7 million euros. In addition to that, the overages of the films mentioned above that cannot be capitalized have to be offset by at least 11.5 million euros. From an economic point of view the remaining negative amount of -13.6 million euros has to be weighed against the immediate savings of at least 16.5 million euros. As another consequence of the sale, the Internationalmedia group will reduce bank liabilities by 64.9 million euros, which will remain with Initial. Compared to 2003 this sale will additionally save overhead and development costs amounting to at least 5.4 million euros. The result from this transaction will be included in the annual financial statements of 2003, which very likely will cause a delay of the final annual financial statements' presentation until April.

In this way, the operational EBITDA earnings improved by 48% from - EUR 6,594 thousand to - EUR 3,412 thousand in 2003 despite a fall in total output of 16% to EUR 19,548 thousand. This was achieved in the main through personnel measures (reduction in personnel expenses by 23% to EUR 12,707 thousand) and cut-backs of 36% in operating expenses from EUR 8,993 to EUR 5,758 thousand. In spite of all the successes achieved on the costs side, earnings were disappointing against a backdrop of the target balanced operating earnings planned for the 2003 financial year. The main reason why the planned targets failed to materialise are shortfalls in sales revenues. When the half-year figures were presented for 2003, BOV AG had already informed its shareholders of this trend. Observing the principles of prudent accounting practice, a number of adjustments were made in the balance sheet (including writing off goodwill to the value of EUR 5,551 thousand and deferred tax assets amounting to EUR 4,000 thousand) comprising a total volume of EUR 11,628 thousand leading to a consolidated net loss of - EUR 14,126. Provisions and reserves for personnel adjustment measures implemented in the first quarter of 2004 and adjustments to work in progress in Switzerland taken to capital at the end of the year, which reduced earnings, also had their adverse effect on results. Taken together, these represent a loss of more than half the share capital in the financial statements for the individual company BOV AG and in the consolidated statements for the Group, which is why we have made the loss notification in accordance with Art. 92 Para. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Law. The Managing Board is drawing up suitable measures and will convene a general meeting of shareholders in the near future to report on the loss situation. With a downward change in cash and cash equivalents of - EUR 5,554 thousand these resources amounted to EUR 5,551 thousand at the end of the fiscal year 2003, with the result that, after deduction of bank loans to the sum of EUR 2,976, the net cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 2,575 thousand. Viewing available liquidity including credit lines granted but not made use of and taking into account sureties provided, the resultant value as at the year-end closing date amounted to EUR 2,145 thousand. In 2002, the average number of employees fell to 277 and to 215 in 2003. Despite the reduction in sales revenues, total output per employee increased by 8%.

       " 'Loss in 2003 higher äs expected - Short-term program for cost reduction launched Bietigheim-Bissingen, 22nd March 2004 During the preparation of the financial Statements of the HEINKEL AG and the HEINKEL Group for the business year 2003 several unexpected effects occurred which will considerably increase the already announced small loss. After the declaration of the financial Statements of our American daughter Company HEINKEL Filtering Systems Inc. we had to implement a subsequent correction of sales and profit because the takeover of a high-value machine was shifted by the customer to the business year 2004. Furthermore, the relative low tumover in the new machine business of the HEINKEL AG entailed a low turn of the stock material and therefore an additional depreciation with a considerable amount. The positive indicators in the 4th quarter for a revitalization of the capital expenditures in the pharmaceutical industry have not yet resulted in an increase of order intake at the years 2003 end - the backlog at 31st December achieved 3.8 Mio. Euro (previous year: 3.1 Mio. Euro). Beyond that an temporarily ongoing reluctance in the Investment activity of our customers can be noticed at the beginning of the year 2004. On the basis of this background the CEO decided a short-term program for a further restructuring and a comprehensive cost reduction. The focus in this program is an outsourcing of activities and a short-term reduction of the human resources to the lower business volume. The intention is to reduce the personnel at the location Bietigheim-Bissingen by 33 employees down to 90 employees. For the realization ofthe short-term program the CEO decided to place an accrual with an amount of 1,1 Mio. EUR in the financial Statements for 2003. The objective is to stabilize the difficult economic and financial Situation of the HEINKEL AG in a short-term and to support a going concern and the future ofthe Company. Under consideration of all extraordinary effects the CEO reports the following preliminary figures for the financial statement for the business year 2003: HEINKELAG HEINKEL Group 2003 2002 2003 2002 Sales 12,0 Mio. EUR 21,7 Mio. EUR 15,8 Mio. EUR 26,4 Mio. EUR Gross Performance 14,2 Mio. EUR 20,4 Mio. EUR 18,2 Mio. EUR 25,3 Mio. EUR Result -1,9 Mio. EUR -4,9 Mio. EUR -3,9 Mio. EUR -4.9 Mio. EUR But nevertheless HEINKEL proceeds on the assumption that after three years with a deep recession in the investments ofthe pharmaceutical industry a stepwise revitalisation ofthe capital expenditures will lead to an increase ofthe order intake at HEINKEL during the year 2004 - latest in the year 2005. With a broader product program and an improved global sales and service network HEINKEL will gain significant advantages frorn this development. Then the considerably improved cost position will offer the immediate return to the profitable zone.

With a sales revenue of 20.7m EUR, ad pepper media increased its turnover by 46% in the year 2003 (previous year: 14.1m EUR). The fourth quarter of 2003 was outstanding, with a turnover of nearly 7m EUR (Q4/2002: 4.9m EUR). The positive turnover trend is also due to the increasing proportion of international campaigns which ad pepper media can handle for many international clients, thanks to its European coverage, international scope and sophisticated systems. In fiscal 2003 the company achieved EBIT of 1m EUR, after a figure of -1.6m EUR in fiscal 2002. This sustained rise in profitability is due to a further increase of 2% in gross margin, as well as the fact that sales and administration costs rose at a less than proportional rate, in spite of the considerable rise in turnover. Consolidated group profits for fiscal 2003 are 2.1m EUR (2002: -0.7m EUR), representing a profit per share of 0.21 EUR (previous year: -0.07 EUR). Operational cashflow for fiscal 2003 was a positive 1.3m EUR (previous year: -2.5m EUR). With a comfortably unchanged stock of liquid funds including short term liquid fixed asset securities and restricted cash of some 28m EUR as of 31 December 2003, ad pepper media rests on its usual solid foundation.

At the same time, Daniele Di Croce is departing from the Executive Board. The Executive Board will therefore consist of three members in the future - the two new ones plus Michael Knopp. The reason for appointing new members to the Executive Board is that Daniele Di Croce, co-founder and CEO of REALTECH AG, is now withdrawing from active management work, as planned since the end of 2003, after 10 years in REALTECH\\'s management and on the Executive Board.

As of the end of the previous year, the company had reported a consolidated net loss of EUR 8.183 million and consolidated sales of EUR 26.611 million. The 21 percent drop in sales revenues was in line with the subdued expectations for the 2003 fiscal year. With 9.1 million subscribed shares, this result corresponds to earnings per share of EUR 0.07. The Saarbrücken based business consultancy company achieved this result via the consistent implementation of the measures presented at the last Annual General Meeting. In addition to the strong positioning in the areas industrial companies, automotive suppliers, the consumer goods industry, and the commerce sector, the cost optimization and variablization measures were also key success factors. At EUR 313,000, the operating results (EBIT) for 2003 were positive (2002: minus EUR 8.618 million), with shareholders' equity increasing to EUR 16.206 million compared with the previous year's figure (2002: EUR 15.613 million).

Sales within the DIS Group fell by 6.1 percent to EUR 218.4 million. Consolidated net income for 2003 as a whole fell by 7.2 percent to EUR 8.4 million. Earnings per share fell by 5.1 percent to EUR 0.66 in 2003. Before goodwill amortisation, this represented a decline of 3.8 percent to EUR 0.80. In view of the strong cash flow and the net cash position of EUR 21.5 million, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are set to propose a dividend increase of 33 percent to EUR 0.40 at the Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2004. On the basis of the general economic situation outlined, the Board of Management of DIS AG expects an increase of around 15 percent to EUR 250 million for 2004 as a whole. This can be attributed both to organic growth of approximately 7 percent and the initial consolidation of the encad Group. As there are currently still too few empirical values regarding the collective wage agreement and the subsequent susceptibility of the customer or the market, the Board of Management's gross margin estimates are conservative and it expects a gross margin decline of 150 basis points to 34.5 percent. Posting a decline of 90 basis points, development in the first two months of 2004 was better than expected, despite the fact that there was one less working day than in the previous year. The gross margin decline in the first two months of 2004 is not due to the introduction of the collective wage agreement, but almost exclusively to the delayed start to a project in the Engineering segment, in particular in the automotive and automotive suppliers industry. Earnings before goodwill amortisation (EBITA) are likely to increase by approximately 12 percent to EUR 19.0 million in the 2004 financial year, with the gross margin decline thus being almost completely offset by improvements in efficiency.

Total revenues amounted to EUR 229.2 million (previous year: EUR 214.5 million; incl. JUMPtec consolidated as of July 3, 2002). The company's operating income (EBIT before extraordinary goodwill amortization in second quarter) of EUR 10.2 million was more than six times that of the previous year (EUR 1.6 million). Net income for the period (before extraordinary amortization) amounted to EUR 5.1 million, compared with EUR 0.7 million in the previous year. Kontron AG's net earnings for 2003 (EUR minus 28.6 million) include the one-off goodwill amortization amounting to EUR 34.7 million in the second quarter that did not affect income. In this way, Kontron is adjusting the book goodwill that arose due to US-GAAP rules as a result of the merger with JUMPtec in 2002.

According to Kontron AG, the trend in the fourth quarter was especially positive. The quarter's sales of EUR 65.6 million were 20 percent higher than those of the previous quarter. Adjusted for the US dollar exchange rate, this represents growth of 12 percent over the fourth quarter of the previous year (EUR 63.7 million). Orders on hand reached a record EUR 100.5 million as of December 31, 2003. Adjusted for exchange rates, they exceeded the previous year's level (EUR 94 million) by 15 percent.

In January 2002, the international investors ABP Investments, BPF-Bouw and Jones Lang LaSalle Co-Investment Inc. exercised a put option resulting in TAG acquiring an 11.75% interest in Bau-Verein zu Hamburg AG. The residual purchase price of roughly EUR 15 million has now been reduced by one third. At the same time, the balance of the purchase price will be paid in instalments up until 2006. In return, TAG will grant the TAG investors an option to transform the residual purchase price receivable into a convertible bond. The reduction in the purchase price was agreed upon in connection with the convertible bond as subsequent partial compensation for the extraordinary restructuring expenses incurred by Bau-Verein zu Hamburg AG in fiscal 2001. The extended repayment period for the residual purchase price also constitutes partial compensation. As a result of this mutual agreement, TAG'S liabilities have been reduced by EUR 5 million, leading to a substantial improvement in its capital structure in connection with the cash capital increase completed in January 2004. In addition, there is a further possibility of transforming borrowed funds into equity in the medium term if the investors exercise their option to transform their investment into a convertible bond which is then converted into equity. These positive results constitute a further milestone in TAG'S efforts to optimize its balance-sheet ratios and structures and have further improved the Company's position in possible acquisition or merger processes in 2004.

Strong balance sheet. Positive multiple-year trend. Dividend distribution recommended for the first time. Stuttgart, 24 March 2004 - Following an exceptional increase in 2002 - primarily caused by a number of special projects - AC-Service closed the financial year 2003 with declines in sales and EBIT stemming from a difficult market environment. An overall positive trend is evident, however, when looking at results over the past several years. As an IT service provider focused on outsourcing, human resources und SAP consulting services, the company finished the financial year 2003 with sales of EUR 48.3 million (prior year: EUR 52.0 million), an EBITDA of EUR 7.7 million (prior year: EUR 9.7 million) and an EBIT of EUR 1.3 million (prior year: EUR 2.9 million). Included here are charges and earnings of a one-time nature or relating to other periods, as well as regular goodwill amortisation of EUR 0.8 million (prior year: EUR 1.0 million). All operating business divisions reported positive segment earnings. Despite the drop in EBIT, the after-tax profit of EUR 1.1 million (prior year: EUR 1.2 million) and the earnings per share of 21 euro cents (prior year: 22 euro cents) are still just about at the same level as a year ago. This is attributable to the application of deferred tax assets from prior years. Through continued stock buy-backs, the average number of shares outstanding declined to 5 264 703 (prior year: 5 381 755).

       " 'Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle: \"We have clearly surpassed our debt reduction targets.\" - Focus on growth and earnings strength - Successful start to 2004 -Net financial liabilities for 2003 reduced by EUR 510 million -Sales for 2003 up 3 % to EUR 8.992 billion, an increase of 7.9 % when adjusted for currency effects -EBITA before special items EUR 671 million, up 3.5 %. -ROCE expected to rise from 7.7 % to 10 % by 2005 -2004: Order intake for the first two months up 7.2 %. \"We shall continue to systematically pursue our endeavors to boost Linde\\'s growth and earnings\", said Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle, President and CEO of Linde AG, at the results press conference held on March 24, 2004 in Frankfurt. In the future, the Group will focus on the high-earnings and high-growth Gas and Engineering and Material Handling business segments, following the sale of Linde Refrigeration to Carrier, the US global market leader for air conditioning and heating systems, a week ago for EUR 325 million - subject to the approval of the anti-trust authorities. Reitzle expressed his confidence that the company would be granted this approval by the end of September of this year at the latest. The CEO emphasized the considerable progress made by the Group once again in 2003 in reducing its net financial liabilities, including financial services. These liabilities were reduced by EUR 510 million in 2003. This includes the transfer of EUR 138 million to a fund for the external financing of pension commitments. Linde had originally planned to reduce its debt by EUR 150 million in 2003. \"We have clearly surpassed our target\", said Reitzle. All in all, the Group reduced its net financial liabilities by EUR 1.367 billion in only three years as opposed to by EUR 1.2 billion in four years, the target set at the beginning of 2001. \"The confidence that the financial markets have in Linde has increased considerably over the past few months\", stressed Reitzle. Linde also announced that Linde Finance B.V. shall be making an offer to the holders of the 2000/2007 6.375 % bond (ISIN DE 0002465952) to repurchase a partial amount of up to EUR 400 million. The offer shall expire on April 6, 2004. According to Hero Brahms, CFO of Linde AG, both sales and new orders were up at the beginning of fiscal year 2004. Domestic sales in particular increased by 5.3 % to EUR 296 million (2002: EUR 281 million), while foreign sales remained almost unchanged at EUR 973 million (2002: EUR 980 million). This put the Group\\'s total sales for the first two months of the year slightly above the previous year\\'s level at EUR 1.269 billion (2002: EUR 1.261 billion). When adjusted for currency effects, this corresponds to an increase of 4.0 %. The Company recorded a particularly substantial increase in sales in the Material Handling business segment, which rose by 9.2 % to EUR 463 million (2002: EUR 424 million). The Group\\'s order intake was encouragingly robust in the first few months of 2004. New orders rose by 7.2 % to EUR 1.522 billion (2002: EUR 1.420 billion), which represents an increase of 11.4 % when adjusted for currency effects. The most notable increase in demand came from abroad. New orders from abroad rose by 8.2 % to EUR 1.212 billion (2002: EUR 1.120 billion), although domestic orders, which were up by 3.3 % to total EUR 310 million (2002: EUR 300 million) also pointed towards a slight recovery in demand. In fiscal year 2003, the Linde Group increased its sales by 3.0 % to EUR 8.992 billion (2002: EUR 8.726 billion) despite the disappointing economic developments that dominated a large part of the year, and negative currency effects. After adjustment for exchange rate effects, the increase in sales totaled 7.9 %. Although the order intake, at EUR 9.079 billion, fell just short of the high level attained in the previous year (EUR 9.322 billion), it was up 1.8 % on 2002 after adjustments for currency effects. EBITA before special items improved by 3.5 % to EUR 671 million (2002: EUR 648 million). \"This 3.5 % increase in the Group\\'s operating result before special items, despite negative currency effects, is an indication of the fact that our Group restructuring programs are starting to bear fruit\", said Reitzle. The return on capital employed before special items (ROCE) - one of the Group\\'s key management indicators - rose from 7.0 % to 7.7 %. Reitzle added that this figure is expected to rise to 10 % by 2005, and that although ambitious, this target is well within reach. The special items in the Group mainly related to provisions totaling EUR 70 million for process optimization programs, EUR 20 million for the reorganization of the Australian Material Handling business, and EUR 50 million for provisions connected with the sale of Linde Refrigeration. As a result of these special items, earnings before income taxes fell from EUR 356 million to EUR 287 million, with net income dropping accordingly by EUR 132 million to EUR 108 million partly due to a higher tax rate. Linde Gas and Engineering remains the Group\\'s largest business segment, recording sales of EUR 5.031 billion (2002: EUR 4.839 billion), up 4.0 %. The effect of the weak dollar on currency translation into euros was particularly pronounced at Linde Gas. At EUR 3.843 billion, sales in this division were just below the level recorded in the previous year (EUR 3.880 billion), yet increased by a substantial 6.2 % when adjusted for currency effects. The unfavorable currency effects also had an impact on the result before special items. These effects knocked EUR 36 million off earnings, which meant that EBITA before special items amounted to EUR 598 million (2002: EUR 606 million). Linde Gas hopes to use the \"Fit for Future\" optimization program to cut costs by EUR 150 million, with these measures becoming fully effective in 2005. Provisions of EUR 10 million were set up for those measures intended to further streamline administrative processes. In 2003, sales at Linde Engineering were up 22.6 % to EUR 1.270 billion (2002: EUR 1.036 billion). A large proportion of these sales were attributable to natural gas, olefin, and air separation plants. EBITA rose by 15.1 % to EUR 61 million (2002: EUR 53 million). The comprehensive restructuring of the Group also started to show signs of coming to fruition in the Group\\'s second largest business segment, Material Handling. Although sales increased by only 2.8 % to EUR 3.063 billion in 2003 as a result of the difficult market environment, EBITA before special items rose by 5.4 % to EUR 156 million (2002: EUR 148 million). This increase was mainly the result of the ongoing process optimization program TRIM.100, the scope of which is to be expanded further. The program is expected to lead to cost savings of EUR 100 million by the end of this year, and to further savings of EUR 50 million in 2005. In order to achieve these targets, the plan is to adjust production capacities, downscale prefabrication activities and integrate administrative functions across the board. These measures account for expenses of EUR 40 million, while the reorganizing of activities in Australia incurred expenses of EUR 20 million. Although sales at Linde Refrigeration had fallen slightly by 1.5 % to EUR 866 million by the end of 2003, the division boosted its operating result by EUR 4 million to EUR 14 million. \"We have set ourselves ambitious targets for 2004, but we believe that we have good opportunities for growth in Eastern Europe, as well as in Asia and the USA. We shall be using our enhanced, more efficient structures to exploit these opportunities and position ourselves as the leading technology company in all of our business areas\", said the CEO. For the current fiscal year and on a comparable basis, Linde expects to record increased sales and results as a result of the restructuring measures it has introduced. In light of current economic uncertainly, however, Linde has not put an exact figure on its targets for the year. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 24.03.2004',\n",

CENTROTEC Hochleistungskunststoffe AG was able to conclude fiscal 2003 with a significant improvement to all key figures. Revenue was boosted by 18% from 98.4 million euros in 2002 to 115.7 million euros in 2003. Earnings per share prior to goodwill amortization rose by 41%, from EUR 0.76 EUR to EUR 1.07, and consequently outstripped the company's own target of EUR 1.00-1.05. After goodwill amortization, EPS amounted to EUR 0.81 (previous year EUR 0.54). The operating result before goodwill amortization (EBIT-A) rose by a disproportionately high 34%, from EUR 11.4 million to EUR 15.2 million. The rate of return for operating activities (ratio of EBIT-A to revenue) rose from 11.5% to 13.1%. Net income was actually boosted by 51%, from EUR 4.1 million in 2002 to EUR 6.3 million in 2003. The mainstays of this growth were CENTROTEC's innovative environmental products for low-energy heating and ventilation systems. The substantial growth in revenue and earnings that has regularly been posted for this area of activity endorses CENTROTEC's strategy of evolving into a company for sustainable energy- saving and health products. This is why Centrotec is changing its name from Centrotec Hochleistungskunststoffe AG to Centrotec Sustainable AG. The new name, which is to be ratified at the Shareholders' Meeting on May 28, 2004, reflects the fact that 80% of revenue is now generated by energy-saving and health products. CENTROTEC forecasts further significant rises for the current fiscal year. Revenue expectations for 2004 centre on growth of around 15% to EUR 130-135 million. The company anticipates that earnings per share (pre-goodwill) will rise by around 25% to EUR 1.30-1.35. After goodwill, this figure will be in the order of EUR 1.00-1.05.

In the past financial year, november AG through uncompromising development was able to significantly rise the company value. Examples for this are the expansion of the diagnostic cooperation with Siemens Medical Solutions into a full strategic partnership, including the option to form a joint company, as well as the development of a new security feature for banknotes together with Hueck Folien GmbH (Austria). This positive development has continued in the beginning of the year as demonstrated by the extended use of DNA codes by Bristol-Myers Squibb (Germany) that was recently announced. The operative developments are supported by restructuring of the entire company into a holding. With nearing market readiness and to respond even faster and react more flexibly to the needs of their market segments and their customers, the previous business units product security/brand protection and diagnostics were spun off in December 2003 into wholly owned subsidiaries. In the year under review, total sales revenues of the companies included in consolidation, i.e. november AG, identif GmbH, directif GmbH and PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH, amounted to EUR 4.4 million (previous year: EUR 3.9 million), equivalent to an increase of 15 percent. Gross profit increased over the previous year by 21 percent (2002: TEUR 1,724). Research and development costs fell significantly by 45 percent to EUR 3.4 million (previous year: EUR 6.2 million). This was largely due to the management buyout of the therapy division with effect as from 1-1-2003 which also strongly effected the number of employees that was reduced from an average of 88 to 63 (full time basis). The group operating result (EBIT) for the financial year 2003 amounted to EUR - 4.4 million and was thus 54 percent better than the previous year's figure of EUR -9.7 million. The consolidated net result in the year under review amounted to around EUR -2.8 million and was thus significantly better than previous year's figure of EUR -5.9 million. At EUR -0.41, the earnings per share (IAS 33) also saw a substantial improvement (previous year: EUR -0.87, IAS 33). The accumulated deficit increased by the consolidated net loss to EUR 24.2 million (previous year: EUR 21.4 million). On 31 December 2003, the consolidated balance sheet total stood at EUR 28.6 million (previous year: EUR 29.6 million). Due to the capital increase successfully carried out in December 2003, total liquidity, including investments, was further improved amounting to EUR 12.5 million at the end of the year (previous year: EUR 15.9 million). Also due to the capital increase the subscribed capital has increased to EUR 7,468,320 (previous year: EUR 6,811,200).

Alphaform AG Enabling Technologies and Services (ticker symbol: ATF) - system supplier for prototypes - posted sales of EUR22.40 million (2002: EUR26.05 million) for the 2003 financial year. This is a decline of 14.0 %. However, the net loss of the year improved to EUR-1.49 million (2002: EUR-2.05 million). Major contributory factors here were streamlining locations in 2002 and the cost reductions within the Group. The 14.6 % year-on- year reduction of administration costs to EUR2.87 million reflects part of the cost optimisation already achieved. The 2003 operating result was EUR-1.68 million (2002: EUR-0.36 million). It was negatively impacted by maintaining production capacity on reduced sales. A difficult market environment was the main feature of the 2003 reporting year. There was extreme restraint in terms of investment propensity, especially in the automobile industry, where the company generated 76% of total sales (2002: 83 %). Nonetheless, in the 2003 reporting year, sales in Germany increased by 5.3% to EUR17.58 million (2002: EUR16.69 million).

The Group's consolidated net result amounted to a loss of EUR 2,372,000. However, this was significantly reduced by 81% against the previous year (EUR 12,344,000). This was primarily due to two factors: The insolvent subsidiary MuK (Berlin) no longer impacted the result in the reporting year. Furthermore, the Company was able to reduce its operating expenses considerably on the back of cost cutting measures. However, these measures will take full effect in 2004. Consolidated sales of EUR 3,554,00 were down 71% year-on-year (2002: EUR 12,344,000), for which MuK was also largely responsible. After becoming insolvent, this company was deconsolidated at the end of 2002. Sales at DCI AG alone declined by only 8.5% year-on-year to EUR 3,370,000 (2002: EUR 3,645,000), as a result of the poor condition of the economy as a whole in the reporting year. The consolidated operating result was minus EUR 2,993,000 (2002: minus EUR 13,632,000). The outflow of cash and cash equivalents decreased to EUR 4,003,000 (2002: EUR 6,804,000).

       " 'Interim report on the business year 2003 Dear Shareholders, The Board informs you that the BWK Group will report a loss of EUR 36.3 million according to IFRS for the financial year 2003, including a loss from non- recurring items totalling EUR 17.1 million. Adopting a pre-cautionary approach, deferred tax benefits have not been included in the results of the combing operations for the year. This would have resulted in a reduction of the loss by EUR 6.4 million. There are several factors causing this disappointing result. Firstly, the closure of the Geelong Wool Combing plant (GWC) was forced on us by a prolonged labour dispute brought about by the uncompromising attitude of the relevant Australian labour union regarding more flexible working hours along the lines of the arrangement in place at Austops. In October 2003 BWK Management decided to close GWC. The necessary provisions and one-off costs impacted the annual result by EUR 15.9 million. Further one off costs include required provisions for personnel restructing measures at the Bremen mill in the amount of EUR 1.2 million. Secondly, the worldwide textile market has experienced a dramatic drop in consumption which impacted on the already weak demand for wool tops in an industry plagued with overcapacity. In addition, the SARS crisis in the first quarter nearly paralyzed the Asiatic textile market for several months. Although more than 80 million kg top production was removed out of the global market in the course of the year, the combing tariffs were still at the lowest level for the last ten years. This also resulted in losses being incurred in the combing mill in Bremen and at Australian Topmaking Services Ltd. (Austop) in Parkes, Australia. Our mill in Turkey achieved a balanced result in 2003. BWK Elders, our joint venture trading companies in Bremen and in Adelaide, Australia, in which BWK AG participates each to 50%, also contributed negatively to the result. The main reason was the subdued demand in the falling market resulting in pressure on margins. The New Zealand trading company J.S. Brooksbank & Co. (Australasia) Ltd., Wellington, was able to continue the good results of the past. As the biggest exporter of greasy wool in New Zealand, this trading company benefited in particular from the stable demand for carpet wools and upholstery fabrics. As in the past the man made fibre business in Bremen and BREWA Umweltservice GmbH, Bremen, produced another profitable operating result. The rebuild of the Bremen plant proceeded as scheduled and will be completed shortly. The rebuild will reduce conversion costs and increase production yields, making the company more competitive. The benefits will become effective in the second half of 2004. We remain confident about the future prospects for wool. After the strong price decreases of the last months wool is now a more competitive fibre than over the past 18 months. Recent fashion collections are showing signs of a return to wool. BWK Management together with the Elders Group continues to pursue the integrated Wool Supply Chain Strategy and remains focussed on further improvements across all of its businesses. On 18 February 2004 the Supervisory Board of the Bremer Woll-Kämmerei AG agreed unanimously to reduce the number of Vorstand members from three to two with effect of 1st March 2004.

On the basis of constant currency rates, revenues were EUR 63.9 million and EBIT EUR 3.1 million. Non-recurring charges of EUR 930,000 negatively impacted the EBIT. Adjusted for currency and non-recurring effects, EBIT is EUR 4.0 million. The result before depreciation on goodwill (EBITA) is EUR 4.6 million, resulting in an EBITA margin of 7.6% (2002: 11.7%). Without adjustments for currency movements and non-recurring effects, the EBITA margin is 8.8%. The operating result is EUR 2.8 million (2002: EUR 6.7 million), equivalent to an EBIT margin of 4.5% (2002: 9.4%). The EBIT margin adjusted for currency changes and non-recurring effects is 6.2%. The non-recurring effects result primarily from the integration of two subsidiaries into Novasoft AG. The restructuring creates an important condition to offset the structurally related high tax rate at Novasoft. Restructuring results in the one-off transfer of deferred taxes of EUR 600,000. The tax rate is thus 92.5%. In the current tax year, restructuring will already pay off in the form of a tax rate at the normal level. It is pleasing that, despite the weak general economic situation in the core retail industry, Novasoft increased revenues by 48.4% (up EUR 9.8 million). This is where the growth potential for the future lies.

Income from operations (EBIT) amounted to EUR 1.4m (compared to EUR 1.9m). The fact no further development expenditure was capitalized because the theGuard! software developed in house had become ready for marketing reduced this figure by around EUR 0.6m. Net income amounted to minus EUR 0.3m (EUR 0.3m), while earnings per share were minus EUR 0.06 (EUR 0.06). This was negatively impacted by EUR 0.7m due to the one-off effect of the write-down of the company's interest in Grau Data Storage AG. REALTECH achieved a cash flow of EUR 4.4m (EUR 4.3m), while net cash and cash equivalents increased to EUR 20.0m - 20% up on the figure of EUR 16.6m recorded on the key date at the end of the previous year. REALTECH expects Group revenue in the fiscal year 2004 to be between 10% and 15% lower than in 2003. The main reason for this is that revenue is declining at the company's Italian subsidiary, REALTECH Italia. The Group is striving to achieve a balanced income from operations. REALTECH AG's Executive Board will be commenting on the results for the fiscal year 2003 and the outlook for 2004 in the context of a telephone conference at 10.00 a.m. A conference for DVFA analysts will be held at 3.00 p.m. in Frank- furt/Main\",\n",
       " 'FJH AG: Result for 2003 amounts to 4.3 million Euro - financial year marked by special factors FJH AG (ISIN DE0005130108), the consultancy and software house listed in the TecDAX index has achieved a result of 4.3 million Euro after tax (2002: 16.5 million Euro). The operating income (EBIT) amounted to 6.9 million Euro (2002: 25.5 million Euro), revenues came to 120.1 million Euro (2002: 130.2 million Euro). Included in these figures is HEUBECK AG which has been consolidated in the second half of the year. In continuation of the dividend policy the Executive and Supervisory Board will suggest to the annual general meeting to use one third of the achieved net income according to IAS to pay out a dividend of 0.20 Euro per share. In order to thank the numerous value investors for their most appreciated commitment to FJH both main shareholders Feilmeier and Junker are willing to go without their dividend for 2003. This will be laid down in a contract. By these means the dividend for all other shareholders can be raised to 0.40 Euro. This renunciation, however, will only come into effect if the financial authorities do not have any tax related objections. After the successful first three quarters the fourth quarter was marked by special factors which influenced the overall result to a major degree. These factors were, for one part, malicious anonymous charges against FJH which, however, could be refuted in a relatively short time. These were furthermore the noticeable reluctance regarding investment decisions by insurers as a result of the political conditions and finally two client projects which had to be stabilised. For these projects additional accruals regarding the finalisation have been provided. For 2004 measures to reduce costs and increase revenues have already been initiated and for a major part also put into effect. The market of insurers particularly relevant for FJH has been largely freed of long standing uncertainties by political decisions in December respectively in the ongoing first quarter. They notably start again to approach the investments which had been postponed to 2004 last year. Because of changes in the law regarding old age pension provision (Alterseinkünftegesetz) and the forthcoming Solvency II regulations further investments will become necessary which can also be seen by the first incoming orders for the software required for this. Against this background the Executive Board is confident to return to traditional profitability by the end of the year.

       " 'The KRONES Group has continued to progress its successful performance of recent years, despite adverse macro-economic conditions in 2003. For the fourth time in succession, the world\\'s market leader for beverage bottling, canning and packaging machinery achieved new bests in terms of order bookings, sales and net income. Order bookings up despite unfavourable macro-economic conditions worldwide In the 2003 business year, KRONES achieved order bookings of 1,441 million euros (+10.1 % up on the preceding year). KRONES was profiting here from a continuingly strong trend towards PET containers. Performance at this technologically front-ranking company was boosted by the growing number of breweries starting to sell their beer in PET bottles, by the aseptic filling technology for fruit juices and water, and by packaging solutions for the food and beverage industry, focusing primarily on milk. High order backlog guarantees optimum capacity utilisation Orders on hand likewise rose to a record level: 619 million euros on the reporting date of 31 December 2003, corresponding to about five months of full production capacity utilisation. The order situation in the first quarter of 2004 showed a further improvement, so that additional sales growth can be predicted for 2004. Double-figure growth in consolidated sales Bucking the general trend in its chosen sector, KRONES successfully upped its sales by +10.0 % to 1,435 million euros (preceding year: 1,305 million euros). This growth is attributable firstly to the market\\'s acceptance of KRONES\\' product innovations, and secondly to its debut in what is called the \"just- enough\" market through the acquisition of KOSME. High productivity secures improved earnings The provisional consolidated result, with a net income for the year of 60.4 million euros after taxes, is likewise a new best for the company (preceding year: 57.3 million euros). Against the background of an increasingly difficult price war, this result constitutes an exceptional achievement, documenting KRONES\\' enhanced competitiveness and high level of productivity. Proposed conversion of preference shares into ordinary stock The group\\'s successful performance has also boosted the prices of the KRONES shares listed on the M-DAX. In order to ensure a sustained improvement in this upward trend, the executive and supervisory boards decided, at the supervisory board\\'s meeting on 24 March, to propose to the AGM on 23 June 2004 a conversion of the hitherto non-voting preference shares (currently 34 % preference shares and 66 % ordinary shares) into KRONES ordinary shares.

       " \"Zapf Creation AG: Publication of audited key financial figures for 2003 and current business development in 2004 Ad-hoc release pursuant to § 15 Wertpapierhandelsgesetz [German Securities Trading Act] Munich/Roedental, March 25, 2004. At today's financial statements press conference, Zapf Creation AG, Europe's leading brand manufacturer of play, functional and mini dolls as well as accessories, confirmed its preliminary sales figure of EUR 201.4 million, which it had announced on January 20, 2004. Compared to previous year's figure of EUR 222.7 millions, currency-adjusted sales were down 4%. In connection with the closing of production in Germany in fiscal year 2003, which was announced in July 2003, a one-off charge of EUR 3.6 million was taken. This charge placed an extraordinary burden on all earnings components. Adjusted for these one-off expenses, the operating result (EBIT) came in at EUR 23.4 million. This corresponds to an operating margin of EUR 11.6% (previous year: 14.8%). Earnings before taxes (EBT) were EUR 19.6 million, down from EUR 30.6 million in 2002. Net income was EUR 14.8 million compared to EUR 21.2 million in 2002. This resulted in earnings per share of EUR 1.87. The reduced profitability of the company is primarily due to the development of business in America, which failed to meet expectations. Nevertheless, the management board and supervisory board will propose a dividend of EUR 1.00 per share entitled to dividend payment to this year's annual stockholders' meeting. In its core segment of play and functional dolls including accessories, Zapf Creation managed to increase sales in Europe by 6% with its brands BABY born(R), Baby Annabell and CHOU CHOU. Zapf Creation thus maintained its market leadership in this region and even gained market share in some European countries. As a result, the company's market share in the five most important European markets in this segment is 30%. This compares to a market share of just 6% in the United States. (*Source: NPD Retail Panel 2003) The management board of Zapf Creation AG expects sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 to remain below last year's figure. The first quarter is characterized by the performance of the developed region of Central Europe (German, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), which contributed 58.7% to overall sales in Q1/2003. This sales region is serviced from the logistics center in Roedental. Due to a conversion of the logistics software, which did not take place seamlessly, this warehouse has a reduced delivery capability in March. This leads to sales reductions in Central Europe. Furthermore, this year important market launches of New BABY born(R) and the Love me CHOU CHOU functional doll will not take place until the second and third quarter of 2004. In previous years, sales development in the first quarter, especially in Germany, was supported by the introduction of My Model (2003) and BABY born(R) miniworld. Sales in the first quarter are offset by relatively high fixed costs, which will result in negative EBIT for the quarter. The first quarter generally is not very indicative of the development of the year as a whole. As wholesalers do not make key listing decisions for the second half of the year until the second quarter, visibility at this point in time is too low to provide reliable guidance for fiscal year 2004 as a whole.

In 2003, Rheinmetall's consolidated sales reached EUR 4,248 million (down from EUR 4,571 million). Adjusted for consolidation group changes and exchange rate effects, actual organic growth was in excess of 4 percent. EBIT amounted to EUR 204 million (down from EUR 392 million, which had included one-off gains from the disposal of Heimann Systems). Adjusted for one-off effects, the operating EBIT totaled EUR 223 million, up 5 percent over the corresponding year-earlier EUR 213 million. This improvement in earnings from operations was achieved despite the fact that the 2003 income statement no longer included the profitable Heimann Systems unit. The adjusted EBIT for 2003 thus reflects all the more visibly the enhanced earnings capability of the Automotive and Defence sectors.

The net return on sales, which totaled EUR 24.2 million in 2003 (2002: EUR 26.0 million), thus rose from 3.9% to 6.4 %. Earnings per share accordingly came to EUR 0.24, up from EUR 0.16 one year earlier. Consolidated sales fell just under seven percent, a change solely attributable to the deterioration in the value of the US dollar against the euro. After adjusting for exchange-rate differences, Group sales actually climbed over 9 %.

One decisive factor behind this strong surge in earnings was the clear growth in the Company\\'s core business. Above all, Jack White Productions AG, the Group parent company, not to mention the \"VI Music\" label run by VIDAL, the Company\\'s Puerto Rican subsidiary, scored outstanding successes in 2003 and made a considerable contribution to the increase in earnings.

The CeVOX system with a disposable optical probe continuously measures oxygen saturation of the blood directly before the heart and gives information about the oxygen balance of the organism and the imminent severity of sepsis. The striking advantage is the possibility to place the probe on demand through a central venous catheter, which is necessary anyway in a patient at shock ward, emergency room, OR and intensive care unit. Sepsis, a generalized whole body inflammation often arises as a consequence of an imbalanced oxygenation of the whole organism. Sepsis is the most common cause of death of intensive care patients and claims more lives than breast, colon, pancreatic and prostate cancer combined. The incidence is increasing and the yearly costs for the health care system of eg. the U.S. are as high as $17 billion. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine, the most renowned medical journal, in 2001 reported that by early, already in the emergency room initiated monitoring of oxygen saturation directly before the heart and thereof deducted goal directed therapy, the mortality of patients could be reduced by 34% and the average hospital stay for patients surviving to discharge was shortened by 3.8 days.

The past year has been pivotal in the turn-around process for the JIL SANDER Group. Undoubtedly, the most significant event of 2003 was Jil Sander\\'s return to her namesake brand that was cheered not only by fashion critics worldwide but also, and perhaps more importantly, by her very loyal client base. Ms. Sander\\'s return was especially important in terms of the overall company strategy, image and brand equity. JIL SANDER Group\\'s financial performance, like those of all luxury brands, was negatively affected by a number of circumstances in 2003 such as the political strife in the Middle East -- namely the War in Iraq --, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the Far East and the appreciation of the Euro against all major world currencies, especially the U.S. dollar and the Japanese Yen. All of these circumstances contributed to a decline in tourism in many of the main cities where JIL SANDER\\'S product lines are distributed. As a consequence, the Group posted revenues of 125.7 million Euro (or 135.1 million Euro at constant exchange rates) in 2003 compared to 138.8 million Euro in 2002. The Group reported a net loss of 28.4 million Euro. JIL SANDER AG sales amounted to 76.5 million Euro in 2003, while its net loss was 28.8 million Euro. \"With this difficult year behind us, we have signs that 2004 is off to a good start thanks to Mrs. Sander\\'s return as Creative Director. Orders and sales for the spring/summer and fall/winter collections have been very strong,\" said Bernhard Wirmer, JIL SANDER Group Chief Financial Officer. \"For 2004, we forecast a significant improvement in sales and a sharp reduction of the Group\\'s losses.\" end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 26.03.2004',\n",

The pro-forma figure for 2002 amounted to EUR 16 million; however, this figure is only comparable to a limited extent as the Hypo Real Estate Group only came into existence in September 2003 as a result of the spin-off of the commercial real estate financing activities of the HVB Group, and accordingly did not exist in its present-day form in the year 2002. The net income in 2003 amounted to EUR 116 million (previous year pro-forma: EUR minus 11 million); after minority interest, consolidated net income amounted to EUR 115 million. This is equivalent to a return on equity after taxes of 2.8%. The development in earnings in 2003 has been boosted by the development in overall business which has been partially better than planned, and also by an one-time income of EUR 35 million attributable to the acquisition of minority interests in the former Westfälische Hypothekenbank. This was opposed by restructuring expenses of EUR 86 million for the business segment Hypo Real Estate Germany. Net income also comprises a positive tax effect of EUR 19 million. This was attributable to the profit-and-loss transfer agreement signed in the year under review by Hypo Real Estate Holding AG and Württembergische Hypothekenbank AG. Net interest income after provisions for losses on loans and advances amounted to EUR 422 million in the Hypo Real Estate Group (previous year pro-forma: EUR 165 million). The provisions for losses on loans and advances comprise a figure of EUR 460 million for the contractually agreed risk shelter provided by HVB AG to Hypo Real Estate Bank AG, (Germany). Hypo Real Estate International has reported a result before taxes of EUR 87 million for 2003. Württembergische Hypothekenbank has reported a pre-tax profit of EUR 54 million. The result before taxes of Hypo Real Estate Germany amounted to EUR minus 11 million. For the year 2004, on the basis of expanding new business abroad and further rapid progress being made with restructuring the domestic portfolio, the Board of Management of Hypo Real Estate Holding AG expects profit before taxes to increase to between EUR 205 million and EUR 225 million in conjunction with an improvement in net return on equity to 3.5 to 4%. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 29.03.2004',\n",

Order Entry reached EUR 101 million showing a stabilization on 2002 level (EUR 104,5 m; -3%). Also in 2003 capacity buys especially in the 200mm segment were missing. Gross margin in 2003 increased - despite the negative currency impact of the US- Dollar - to 39.4% (2002: 37.6%). Due to additional factors, including valuation allowance on losses carried forward, EAT (Earning after Tax) totalled EUR -14.5. Tax rate was at 19% instead of typically approx. 38%. The primary target for 2003, a balanced Free Cash Flow (Operating Cash Flow less investments) with EUR 4.6 million was clearly exceeded. On December 31, 2003 SUSS MicroTec Group had EUR 23.6 million in liquid assets (EUR 26.8 m cash at banks; EUR 3.2 m current liabilities to banks). The Group's equity margin was 64% (2002: 68%). Inventories were further reduced to EUR 41.9 million. The number of employees at year end was 716 (2002: 878). Outlook 2004: SUSS MicroTec's Management Board expects for 2004 a sustainable increase in production equipment demand particularly in Asia and North America. After two years of investments in technology the customers now require production equipment. Thus an order entry increase of about 20% is expected and also to achieve break even on EBIT level. Currently, EBIT break even is in the rage of EUR 115 to 120 million.

       " 'Wiesbaden, 30.03.2004. ACG AG announces today the results for the fiscal year 2003 which ended on Dec. 31, 2003. Due to the concentration strategy on only 1 out of 3 divisions, ACG reports as from now only on the continuing operations in accordance with US-GAAP. The divisions, which have been divested, are presented in the report as discontinued operations. During the period ACG registered sales of EUR 121.6 mn. Sales were thus 44% lower than the prior year amount of EUR 218.3 mn. Taking into consideration a controversial CPU transaction in the amount of EUR 57.8 mn, sales declined by 24%. Due to the lower sales volume the gross profit declined from EUR 19.8 mn to EUR 12.4 mn. The gross profit margin on the other hand improved from 9.1% in 2002 to 10.2%. EBITDA of EUR -9.9 mn was negative following EUR -11.4 mn in 2002. The development of sales and gross profit is attributable in particular to the considerable decrease of the CPU business. EBIT amounted to EUR -13.7 mn (2002: EUR -37.0 mn) and the net result to EUR -30.0 mn (2002: EUR -46.6 mn). The free cash flow was negative at EUR -16,3 mn following EUR -1,3 mn in 2002. The liquid assets amounted to EUR 18.0 mn as at Dec. 31, 2003 versus EUR 17.1 mn as at Dec. 31, 2002. In Feb. 2003 an amount of EUR 9 mn was refunded to the German tax authorities regarding a controversial transaction. In this respect it must be taken into consideration that all liabilities to banks had been reduced to zero. Substantial amounts will accrue to ACG in 2004 from the divestments of companies during 2003. The equity ratio of ACG decreased slightly to 60.0% as at Dec. 31, 2003. This amounted to 60.5% as at Dec. 31, 2002. At Dec. 31, 2003 there were 220 employees. The discontinued operations, microIDENTT and ACG ID achieved sales of EUR 9.4 mn and EUR 54.3 mn respectively during 2003. Their corresponding net income amounted to EUR -2.3 mn and EUR -15.4 mn. In total ACG is targeting sales of EUR 174.4 mn in 2004 (The Board is expecting sales of EUR 25 mn during the first quarter of 2004). Moreover, ACG plans to achieve an EBITDA of EUR 2.5 mn and a net result of EUR 1.2 mn. The objective for 2004 is to increase the gross profit margin to about 13%. At the same time the high administration costs incurred during 2003 must again be reduced substantially; these were impacted to a large extent by one-time effects in connection with the divestments of the companies.

       " \"VIVA Media group 2003: reorientation The phase of reorientation within the VIVA Media group continued in 2003. After the clear return to the profit zone in the TV production segment, adjustments and measures were carried out in the music TV segment. The positive development in the TV production segment was mirrored by an increase in consolidated sales from EUR 113 million to EUR 114 million in 2003. The downward trend in advertising revenues and the non-operating measures in the music TV segment led to consolidated EBITA of EUR -4.4 million (prior year: EUR 26.0 million). In this context, it should be noted that a provision of EUR -6.4 million for the purchase price adjustment for VIVA PLUS dampened the result in 2003 while the result in 2002 was boosted by extraordinary income of EUR 29.7 million from the purchase price payment made by Time Warner for the 49% shareholding in VIVA PLUS. Without these distortions, EBITA would have increased from EUR -3.7 million (2002) to EUR 2.0 million (2003). Extraordinary goodwill amortization of EUR -18.3 million was recognized for the music TV segment owing to the conservative accounting approach. This resulted in the group disclosing EBIT of EUR -27.2 million (2002: EUR 18.0 million) and a loss after tax of EUR -42.3 million (2002: EUR 0.9 million). This represents a loss per share of EUR -1.73 (2002: EUR +0.04). Adjusted for the non-operating effects, a loss per share of EUR -0.55 would have been achieved (prior year: EUR -0.45). Sales in the TV production segment in 2003 were up 9% from EUR 55.4 million to EUR 60.3 million. EBITA rose considerably from EUR -1.5 million to EUR 9.7 million. Earnings of EUR 2.4 million after taxes and minorities were thus disclosed (prior year: EUR -12.6 million). The impact from the weak advertising market due to the poor economic climate and from the structural crisis in the music industry had a negative effect on VIVA's music TV activities in 2003. This resulted in a decline in sales from EUR 56.0 million to EUR 53.4 million. EBITA came to EUR - 14.1 million in 2003 due to the purchase price adjustment for VIVA PLUS (prior year: EUR 28.5 million). Due to goodwill amortization totaling EUR -20.7 million, EBIT stood at EUR -34.7 million (prior year: EUR 25.7 million) and the loss after tax stood at EUR -44.5 million (prior year: EUR 14.4 million). VIVA Media expects consolidated sales to remain stable in 2004 and EBITA to improve significantly against the prior year. Depending on the advertising environment, a slight increase in sales in the music TV segment is forecast and EBITA is expected to rise. In light of the very good order backlog, the TV production segment of BRAINPOOL TV GmbH again expects to have a strong fiscal year in 2004. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 30.03.2004\",\n",

Consolidated earnings before taxes (EBT) increased by 21.0% from EUR 35.2 million to EUR 42.5 million, clearly exceeding the Company's most recent forecast of 10% EBT growth. Consolidated net income for the year before minority interests rose by 20.1% from EUR 15.4 million to EUR 18.5 million. The Managing Board of the supplier of mobility services attributes the clear improvement in earnings despite a difficult market environment primarily to the further growth of its leasing business, improved management of the Company's rental fleet and the optimisation of cost structures in the Group in all. The Vehicle Rental Business Unit generated EBT of EUR 28.6 million (previous year: EUR 22.5 million, up 27.2%). The Leasing Business Unit recorded EBT of EUR 12.2 million, up 10.8% year-on-year (2002: EUR 11.0 million). Other business activities (including e-Sixt AG, which is no longer operated as a separate business unit) contributed EUR 1.7 million to EBT (2002: EUR 1.7 million). The proportion of EBT accounted for by foreign activities increased to EUR 3.4 million (2002: EUR 1.9 million). At EUR 891.6 million, consolidated operating revenue from rental and leasing business was - as predicted - roughly on a par with the previous year (EUR 893.8 million, down 0.2%). As in 2002, revenue from vehicle sales amounted to EUR 1.33 billion. As a result, there was only a minor change in total consolidated revenue to EUR 2.23 billion (previous year: EUR 2.22 billion, up 0.1%). The Managing Board plans to distribute a dividend of EUR 0.50 per ordinary share and EUR 0.52 per preference share, which is unchanged on the previous year. This figure is intended to accommodate shareholders' entitlement to a return as well as the need to further strengthen the Company's equity base. On the whole, Sixt is optimistic about 2004. Provided that the overall economy in Europe picks up and rental prices remain stable as in 2003, the Managing Board is continuing to predict an increase in consolidated operating revenue of around 5% and a rise in EBT of at least 10%\",\n",

This corresponds to 3.6% growth. However, unfavourable exchange rate fluctuations (GBP/EUR) curbed sales growth. Given constant exchange rates, sales of EUR 15.5 Mio. would have been generated, which is equivalent to a growth rate of 9.2%. Net income amounts to KEUR 2,758 (previous year KEUR 408), which equates to EUR 0.23 earnings per share; the target for the year was EUR 0.20 per share. During the financial year, Syzygy AG was able to generate a positive operating income of KEUR 781(corresponds to an EBIT margin of 5.3%). Operating cash flow stood at EUR 4.2 Mio. and was thus well over the level of EUR 3.3 Mio. achieved in 2002. Liquid funds rose by EUR 3.8 Mio. and currently stand at EUR 62.1 Mio.

       " \"Neue Sentimental Film AG making money again ! Frankfurt am Main, March 30, 2004 - Neue Sentimental Film AG (NSF), a leading international media company for the production of advertising films, corporate and brand communication, TV formats and music videos published its figures for fiscal year 2003 today. Sales totaled EUR 26.3 million, allowing Neue Sentimental Film AG to meet its forecast for fiscal year 2003 totaling EUR 26.0 million. EBIT totaled EUR -1.8 million as of December 31, 2003, EBT totaled EUR -2.1 million; these indicators were thus up 81 % respectively on the previous year (EBIT 2002: EUR -9.9 million, EBT 2002: EUR -11.2 million). The company's earnings are again characterized by significant amortization and depreciation and write downs as well as other one-off expenses. These stem from staff cuts as well as consolidation within the network. These costs are the primary reason that it was not possible to record a balanced result in the fourth quarter of 2003. In total, at the end of fiscal year 2003 the number of employees fell by 25 to a total of 60. This has resulted in one-off expenses totaling EUR 2.2 million in 2003. Of this amount, EUR 1.4 million impacts EBIT. After adjustment for one-off expenses, this results in EBIT totaling EUR -0.4 million and EBT of EUR -0.7 million. The fact that Neue Sentimental Film AG has again recorded a significantly positive cash flow since the fourth quarter of 2003 is worthy of particular mention. The company was able to generate a net cash inflow totaling EUR 864 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2003 for the first time since its IPO. If the net cash provided by the capital increase at the end of 2003 is excluded, the cash flow would have been positive and totaled EUR 114 thousand. Over the year as a whole, cash flow growth has been positive. Whereas funds totaling EUR 19.2 million and EUR 5.4 million were used in 2001 and 2002 respectively, in 2003 this figure totaled just EUR 0.3 thousand (EUR 1.0 million without taking the capital increase into account). As economic developments currently do not give any realistic reasons to anticipate increasing growth rates, the company is forecasting sales for 2004 at the same level as the previous year - however with slightly positive earnings from operations for the year as a whole. Neue Sentimental Film AG's clients in 2003 included for example Opel, Allianz, Diebels, Burger King, DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Telekom, Dr. Oetker, DWS, Haribo, Reemtsma, MediaMarkt, Mercedes-Benz, MTV, Postbank, Unilever, Wella and ZDF.

       " \"NEXUS: Improved earnings in 2003, positive result in the 3rd and 4th quarter Villingen-Schwenningen, March 30th, 2004: NEXUS AG, Villingen-Schwenningen, is listed in the Prime Standard and posted consolidated sales of KEUR 13,862 in 2003(previous year KEUR 14,203). The company improved earnings before taxes of KEUR -742 in 2003 following KEUR -854 in the previous year. EBITDA was substantially increased by KEUR 828 to KEUR 1,223. Operative cash flow development was also positive, up KEUR 2,414 to KEUR 1,243 (previous year KEUR -1,171). After a weak first half-year, the last two quarters of 2003 ended with positive earnings before taxes and a positive operative cash flow of KEUR 973. In the core business of Healthcare Software, sales increased by 7% over the entire year to KEUR 9,308 (previous year KEUR 8,652). In the Healthcare Service division, the continually declining hardware business generated sales of KEUR 4,554 after KEUR 5,551 in the previous year. After-tax earnings decreased from KEUR -372 in 2002 to KEUR -1,092. The new treatment of deferred taxes led to expenditures of KEUR 448 after income of KEUR 462 in the previous year. As such, the values are no longer comparable. The positive development of the NEXUS group in 2003 resulted from good order development in the Healthcare Software division. This was attributable in particular to large orders in Basle, Tilburg and Kuwait, which led to an increase in orders on hand. NEXUS develops and markets software and hardware solutions for the medical sector. These solutions make it possible for hospitals, rehabilitation and social facilities to digitalize their patient records. NEXUS' goal is integrated healthcare which ensures the exchange of data between general practitioner, hospital and rehabilitation clinic\",\n",
       " '- Currency-adjusted sales rise by 8.3% to EUR 41.8 million - Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) increase by 67.8% to EUR 2.9 million - Pre-tax earnings doubled at EUR 2.4 million - EBIT margin climbs to a new record level of 7.2% - Company poised for a quantum leap in 2004/2005 Delbrück, March 30, 2004 - The usual pleased expressions were noted when paragon AG\\'s financial statements are announced: The Company, quoted in the Prime Standard segment of the German stock exchange, was able to report record sales and the best earnings in the Company\\'s history. Currency-adjusted Group revenues rose by 8.3% to EUR 41.8 million, while EBIT grew at an even greater rate than sales by 67.8% to EUR 2.9 million (prior year: EUR 1.7 million As a result, paragon\\'s EBIT margin rose to record heights of 7.2% (prior year: 4.5%). Unprecedented figures also in pre-tax earnings (EBT) at EUR 2.4 million, double last year\\'s level of EUR 1.2 million. paragon AG\\'s Managing Board finds its expectations confirmed by these figures. The long term philosophy is now paying off: The strategy of discovering profi- table market niches distinguishes the company from the competition and sets the stage for success even in times of economic restraint. Group sales rose by 5.4% to EUR 40.7 million without taking into account currency adjustment (prior year: EUR 38.6 million). EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) were 30.1% above the previous year\\'s level (EUR 4.8 million) at EUR 6.2 million. Consolidated net income did in fact remain at approximately the previous year\\'s level at EUR 1.4 million (prior year: EUR 1.5 million); the Managing Board stressed, however, that due to the inclusion of deferred capitalized tax claims taken to income during 2002, consolidated net income of fiscal 2003 is not comparable to that of the previous year. The earnings per share figure for fiscal 2003 was thus EUR 0.34 (prior year: EUR 0.37). Majority of sales generated by the Automotive business Most sales were once again generated by the Automotive business in the product areas of air-conditioning systems and operating controls for cars. Sales grew by 8.5% in fiscal 2003 over the previous year to EUR 24.5 million (prior year: EUR 2.6 million). This area of business thus accounted for 60.2% of Group sales. According to the board, enormous growth potential for the Group exists in the Automotive business area. For instance in addition to success with the products developed in-house for the air quality sensor product line, paragon added almost all Daimler models by acquiring Bosch\\'s related business division at the beginning of 2004; this has further strengthened the position as global market leader. Currency-adjusted sales from the Electronic Solutions business - where paragon provides integrated total solutions for the industrial electronics sector - were equivalent to the previous year\\'s level. Without currency adjustment, sales were at EUR 15.0 million (prior year: EUR 16.1 million); corresponding to a 36.7% share of total sales (prior year: 41.6%). The US subsidiary, Miquest Corp., contributed annual sales of EUR 5.7 million (prior year: EUR 6.8 million) to these results. The depreciation in the value of the dollar during 2003 had a negative impact in this connection. Miquest achieved sales equal to those of the previous year of EUR 6.8 million when adjusted for currency effects. The business area of Building Technology, in which paragon applies insights gleaned from the automobile field to create an innovative product portfolio for the building area were reported separately for the first time and showed reve- nues of EUR 1.3 million during fiscal 2003. The proportion of total sales thus amounts to 3.1%. The number of employees rose in parallel with sales and earnings: The paragon Group engaged 238 employees world-wide as at December 31, 2003 (prior year: 216). Group equity amounted to EUR 12.1 million (prior year: EUR 11.2 million), corresponding to an equity ratio of 35.2% (prior year: 34.8%). At the balance sheet date, cash and cash equivalents were at EUR 2.5 million (prior year: EUR 3.8 million). According to the Managing Board, the reduction in liquid resour- ces can be traced to a number of prepayments for investments that were only fully completed in 2004. Investment at record levels During fiscal 2003 paragon invested the hitherto unprecedented sum of EUR 7.0 million (prior year: EUR 4.8 million) in part for the expansion of the company headquarters in Delbrück (Westphalia) and the production site in Suhl (Thurin- gia) as well as new production technology. paragon plans to raise investment to approx. EUR 16 million during fiscal 2004, if not even higher, according to the management board. The investment focus was on the acquisition of Robert Bosch GmbH\\'s air quality sensor division effective January 2, 2004, continued expan- sion of the Delbrück and Suhl sites, as well as new sensor element manufactu- ring facilities under construction. Capital market transaction planned The management board perceives the Company as poised before a quantum leap in 2004/2005: paragon is currently in a growth phase that is likely to become ever more dynamic. A whole range of opportunities exist for paragon to significantly expand its position as component supplier to the car industry, electronic ser- vices provider and building technology specialist in the global market. paragon will grasp these opportunities. According to the board, it is a favorable moment to undertake further acquisitions and investments in markets and products. The economy has not yet accelerated, so that numerous attractive options are arising with respect to paragon\\'s future strategic direction. In order to take advantage of these opportunities quickly when they arise, the Company\\'s financial flexibility will soon be enhanced by a capital market transaction. The Company excludes a capital increase, however. Most of the details are already organized, therefore the announcement on April 2, 2004 should be released as planned. A financing concept for appealing market and positioning opportunities elaborated prior to the AGM on May 12, 2004 will be presented to the shareholders for resolution. Further details will be found in the invitation to the AGM, which is to be published in the Electronic Federal Gazette on April 2, 2004. Sales expectations for 2004 at EUR 58.4 million In the first two months of the current fiscal year Group sales have risen by 30% compared to the previous year. According to the Managing Board, the paragon Group plans that sales for the whole of 2004 will increase to EUR 58.4 million supported by all business areas, as well as an earnings rise that will again be at a greater rate than the sales increase. Significant sales and earnings increases are also anticipated for the US. In the medium term the goal is to attain the desirable \"Tier 1\" status for direct supply to the Big Three\\' - GM, Ford and Chrysler - and thereby achieve a breakthrough for our automotive products. Based on the continued gratifying pace of corporate development we expect to pay a dividend starting in fiscal 2005',\n",
       " 'elexis ad hoc announcement on the results of the fiscal year 2003 +++ High cash flow results in strong increase in liquidity +++ Turnaround in EBIT as well as in net income after interest and taxes +++ Incoming orders rise by about 20% during the first quarter 2004 Wenden, March 30, 2004 - Thanks to the positive development of business during 2003 elexis AG has achieved a significant improvement in all its key financial data. Cash flow and net liquidity The cash flow from operating activities increased from euro -0.9 million in the prior year to euro 8.0 million in the fiscal year 2003. This resulted in an increase in net liquidity from euro 0.8 million (2002) to euro 4.2 million. Simultaneously, the long term liabilities to banks were reduced by euro 3.9 million to euro 26.2 million. The tight liquidity situation of 2002 can be considered as having been overcome due to the improved financial and earnings situation. Net income and EBIT With net income of euro 0.4 million the Company managed to exceed breakeven after interest and taxes. The original objective of achieving a turnaround before interest and taxes was clearly surpassed. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted to euro 3.5 million in the period under report. During the prior year it amounted to euro -6.9 million on a comparable basis. EBIT in 2002 amounted in fact to euro -10.2 million including the Production Systems, Automotive and Steel division which no longer belongs to the elexis Group as well as ASG GmbH. Restructuring The Management Board of elexis AG considers that the restructuring of the Group has been concluded to a large extent. The considerable improvements in sales and in project processing as well as the cost reductions realised through the move of the headquarters of the holding company (AG) from Frankfurt am Main to Wenden near Olpe indicate sustainable profitability of the elexis Group in the future. Sales and incoming orders The sales of the elexis Group in its present form increased during 2003 by 2.6% to euro 105.9 million. Incoming orders rose by 22.6% to euro 116.6 million. Incoming orders thus exceeded sales by 10%. This indicates marked organic growth during the coming months. Outlook The positive development of business in 2003 has also continued during the first few months of the new fiscal year. During the first quarter of 2004 incoming orders increased by approximately 20% versus the comparable prior year quarter on the basis of preliminary estimates. During the first three months of 2003 incoming orders in the amount of euro 29.1 were registered. Sales also rose. However, the increase in this respect was somewhat lower. The Management Board of elexis AG is confident that the increasing sales will be accompanied by a marked improvement in the results. elexis AG will publish the results of the first quarter of the current fiscal year by May 14, 2004.

The drop in sales is primarily due to the deconsolidation of the French subsidiary and the focus on the consulting business. Gross profit reached a high of EUR 43.2 million (2002: EUR 52.1 million). EBITDA climbed by 57% to EUR 3.5 million (2002: EUR 2.3 million). EBIT also improved exceptionally by 146% to EUR 2.5 million (2002: EUR -5.4 million). As a result of the healthy liquidity situation, interest expenses were reduced substantially resulting in EBT of EUR 2.4 million (2002: EUR -5.8 million / 142%). Consolidated EPS equates to EUR 0.41 (2002:EUR -1.77) undiluted. Cash flow in the Group totals EUR 4.93 million (2002:EUR 2.79 million). The equity ratio rose from 30% in 2002 to 41%. At the end of 2003, the equity amounted to EUR 10.06 million (2002: EUR 8.27 million). Short-term bank liabilities due to our business banks were cut back completely.

In Germany, sales of EUR 68.8 million (2002: EUR 75.8 million / -9%) were generated in the reporting period. The main reason for the drop in sales was the reduced sales in the hardware segment, which fell by 36%. Nevertheless, gross profit rose by 3% from EUR 40.2 million to EUR 41.4 million. EBITDA in Germany came to EUR 3.0 million (2002: EUR 2.0 million / +50%). EBIT in Germany amounted to EUR 2 million (2002: EUR -8.6 million / +123%).

       " \"Result for Financial Year 2003 Supervisory Board Appoints New Management Board Member Nuremberg/Munich, March 30, 2004: TA Triumph-Adler announced its result for financial year 2003: Consolidated sales in financial year 2003 (Dec. 31) declined by approximately 24 % to EUR 484 m (previous year: EUR 638 m). This is due to the sale of the remaining TA Beteiligung companies in June 2003. Sales in the core business of office communication came to EUR 408 m, matching the previous year's level. The Imaging business segment generated EUR 314 m of this amount (previous year: EUR 304 m) and the Presentation and Media Technology business segment EUR 94 m (previous year: EUR 104 m). The TA Beteiligung companies that were sold (consolidated until June 30, 2003) accounted for sales of EUR 76 m (previous year: EUR 230 m). The Group's operating profit (EBITDA) amounted to EUR 14 m (previous year: EUR 35 m), with the Imaging business segment accounting for EUR 40 m of this sum (previous year: EUR 37 m). The Presentation and Media Technology business segment achieved a break-even result (previous year: EUR 6 m). The EBITDA of TA Beteiligung was break-even up to the date of deconsolidation. The company disposals in 2003 resulted in total expenses of EUR 10 m. In addition, the Central Division impacted the result by EUR 16 m (previous year: EUR 21 m). After depreciations from ordinary operations of EUR 28 m (previous year: EUR 33 m), net interest expenses of EUR 11 m (previous year: EUR 16 m) and expenses for minority interests and taxes totaling EUR 3 m (previous year: EUR 5 m), earnings before goodwill amortization and deferred taxes came to EUR -28 m (previous year: EUR -19 m). The consolidated net loss amounted to EUR 26 m (previous year: EUR 24 m).

The missing purchasing power in 2003 was notifiable in all business segments of the group in spite of the various product innovations of TIPTEL. In the European foreign countries TIPTEL achieved 43.1 percent of the total turnover. In a comparison of countries the Benelux countries developed especially positively with a turnover plus of about 18 percent in 2003. In 2003 TIPTEL undertook further efforts for improving the profitability of the group. The expenses could still be kept constantly low in 2003 and could partly be reduced to a new minimum level. In the past business year TIPTEL achieved a significant improvement of the operational results. With positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of KEUR + 515 in 2003 the group showed, for the first time since 2001, a positive result (EBITDA 2002: KEUR - 495; 2001: KEUR - 3,774). The earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounts to KEUR - 785 (2002: KEUR - 2,385; 2001: KEUR - 6,213). Accordingly, in the business year 2003, the consolidated losses were reduced to KEUR - 1,170 whereas, in the previous year, a deficit of KEUR - 2,750 was shown. A decisive change took also place concerning the liquidity situation of TIPTEL AG. Due to the consequent reduction of stocks the inventories of the group were reduced by 14.2 percent. Thus, the cash-flow improved with a positive cash- flow of current activities from KEUR - 591 in 2002 to KEUR + 239 in 2003. By 31st December 2003 the group disposed of liquid funds to the amount of KEUR + 1,164. Thus, the liquidity situation compared to previous year's balance sheet date improved by 22 percent.

       " 'Stuttgart, March 30, 2004 - According to preliminary figures, the Dürr Group increased consolidated sales in fiscal 2003 by about 8% to over Euro 2.2 billion (2002: Euro 2.1 billion). Also, at Euro 2.4 billion, new orders were slightly above the high level of 2002 (Euro 2.3 billion). Adjusted for exchange rate effects, sales would be about 17% and new orders about 10% above year-earlier levels. Earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 amount to about minus Euro 7 million. The main reasons for the earnings decline compared with the year before (2002: Euro 22.6 million) are restructuring costs particularly for closing the Schenck premanufacturing plant in Darmstadt (Euro 18.4 million). Added to that are expenses for no longer needed interest rate swaps and impairment losses on the book value of investments (Euro 11 million). Without these latter adjustments, earnings before taxes would be in the slightly positive range, as announced in the report on the third quarter of 2003. A valuation allowance in the amount of Euro 23 million on deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards has resulted in a net loss of about Euro 30 million for fiscal 2003. Since this valuation allowance is expense-neutral, Dürr shows positive cash flow from business operations for last year (about Euro 50 million). Dürr expects significantly positive earnings before taxes in fiscal 2004, to which the SPRINT SQUARE earnings enhancement program will contribute substantially.

Nordex AG's management board assumes that a loss equaling half of the Company's share capital (EUR 52.05 million) was sustained as of March 31, 2004. However, this is in line with the restructuring schedule, which provides for a reduced loss this fiscal year. Given the Company's current business performance, there is no danger of its share capital being fully eroded. In any case, the Company plans to post operating earnings again next fiscal year (2004/05) and to strengthen its capital base at the completion of restructuring activities. This is also set out in the restructuring report compiled by Roland Berger Strategy Consultants. On the basis of the preliminary figures for the first half of 2003/04, Nordex AG's operative business is exceeding forecasts. Order receipts as of March 31, 2004 came to around EUR 120 million (forecast: EUR 100 million). In the previous year, new business in the first six months stood at EUR 107 million, including orders worth EUR 40 million from the previous period (2001/02), which had been delayed due to the application of stricter recognition criteria. As expected, revenues were down on the first quarter of the fiscal year on account of seasonally weak demand in Germany. On the other hand, the loss at the EBIT level should be substantially lower compared with the previous year thanks to a reduced cost-of-materials ratio. In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, Nordex was able to cut its operating loss by half (Q1 loss at the EBIT level: EUR 6.7 million). This positive trend reflects the preliminary effects of the restructuring program implemented in summer 2003, around 63 percent of which has already been completed. In this connection, Nordex plans to achieve a swing of EUR 72.5 million on the bottom line in fiscal 2004/05 and thus return to profit-making territory.

       " 'DataDesign AG has successfully continued its restructuring measures and has been able to achieve a strongly improved performance in the business year 2003. DataDesign AG, Munich, an IT service company and a specialist in the e-banking sector, has recorded sales of 3.8 Mio Euro during the business year 2003 (5.6 Mio. Euro in the preceding year). This corresponds to a decline of the 32 % in comparison to the preceding year. Operating results (EBIT) for the year 2003 amounted to - 0.81 Mio Euro (- 1.84 Mio Euro in the preceding year). This is an improvement in the EBIT of more than 100 %. Both the sales and the results show that DataDesign AG was not able to avoid the influence of a restrained economic climate, but that it has been able to use this business year for sensible restructuring measures for an optimized position in the future. The restructuring programme, which was started in the year 2002, has clearly shown its effect, and it hast made it possible for DataDesign AG to once more focus intensively on the operations side of its business, an on the acquisition of new customers during the running business year. The number of staff members has declined by more than half during the past business year. By the end of the business year the staff consisted of 32 employees (72 employees in the preceding year). Sales per employee amounted to 119 TEuro in the year 2003 (77 Teuro in the preceding year). This shows an increase of almost 60 % in comparison to the previous year, and it will be the basis for a successful 2004. The (undiluted) result per share amounts to 0.51 Euro (- 1.66 Euro in the preceding year), which is an improvement of over 200 % in comparison to the previous year. For the business year 2004, the company is forecasting an ongoing improvement in overall results.

The assets included in the transaction are production locations and sales operations in South Africa, Australiasia, SE Asia North America and the UK In autumn 2003, the H&R Wasag group based in South Emsland, Germany, acquired BP's European special products activities, thereby becoming one of the largest provider of chemical-pharmaceutical specialities in Europe. Acquiring these additional locations and activities, with effect from July 1, 2004, will enable H&R WASAG to gain a global presence in the special products business in a single step by taking over leading competitive positions in important regions and product markets. This was not possible without the acquisition because it was not possible to supply these markets competitively from within Europe due to high logistical costs. The acquisition is subject to approval by local competition authorities. The newly acquired activities will generate a sales volume of over EUR 50,000,000 per annum and hold significant earning potential. The major share of sales will be in the further processing of crude oil-based materials for speciality products such as waxes, softening agents and process or base oils, which are already produced by the group in Europe. The acquisition also includes global sales and distribution locations as well as the supply rights to speciality products from a refinery in South Africa that will be sold via the group's own sales and distribution organization and partners in future. By acquiring the BP activities the chemical/pharmaceutical raw materials division's existing product portfolio will be supplemented by specialty products for use in the cable industry. H&R WASAG AG is not currently represented in this market segment. By expanding its international presence across four continents, the group will be able to gain new strategic customers and consolidate existing customer relations. Over and above this, total production and sales capacities will be reoptimized on an expanded level. Cost savings will be generated from the synergies provided by increased supply levels and by centralized management. The new locations in Africa, Asia and Australia will facilitate and speed up market entry for the H&R Wasag groups's two other divisions, plastics and explosives. The plastics division plans to build production facilities in China, whilst the South African and Australian markets are of prime importance to the explosives-related activities. The European special products activities acquired from BP with economic effect from January 2, 2004 have performed as anticipated during their first few months as part of the H&R WASAG AG group with the quantities produced and sold at the refinery in Hamburg-Neuhof and in additional locations in England and the Netherlands fully meeting the group's expectations. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 02.04.2004\",\n",
       " '9th Annual General Meeting of Clariant / AGM approves capital increase Muttenz, Switzerland, April 2, 2004 - At the 9th Annual General Meeting of Clariant held at the Messe Congress Center in Basel, the shareholders today approved the proposal of the Board of Directors for an ordinary capital increase. The shareholders endorsed the annual report and granted discharge to the Board of Directors and Board of Management. The also approved the proposal of the Board of Directors to distribute a gross dividend of CHF 0.20 per share. Robert Raeber, Chairman of the Board, pointed out in his welcome address that Clariant was much stronger now than it had been one year ago. He stressed that the restructuring process was well underway and that the package of measures initiated was the right way and a necessary step in turning Clariant into a dynamic, strong-earning and world-class specialty chemical company. According to Raeber, the resumption of a dividend payment and the better-than-average performance of the Clariant share since the last AGM are clear signs that the company is returning to health. CEO Roland Lösser recalled that in the past year Clariant had managed to lift its sales in local currency terms by 1% and to post net income of CHF 161 million despite difficult market conditions. Through a series of stringent cost- cutting measures, Clariant maintained its operating margin at the prior-year level. He also pointed out that the company had reduced its net debt to below CHF 3 billion. As regards the capital increase, Lösser said: \"This is an important milestone in the transformation program because it substantially improves our balance sheet structure. In addition it gives us financial flexibility and will enable us to swiftly implement the numerous projects in the performance improvement program.\" The shareholders subsequently ratified the ordinary capital increase that the Board had requested and approved all the proposals of the Board of Directors. The main terms are as follows: - Increase of the share capital by CHF 383,600,000 from CHF 767,200,000 to CHF 1,150,800,000 through the issuance of 76,720,000 fully paid registered shares with a par value of CHF5 each at a subscription price of CHF 12 representing aggregate proceeds before expenses of approx. CHF 920 million. - The pre-emptive rights (Bezugsrechte) of the existing shareholders are withdrawn in favor of a bank syndicate which will underwrite all the shares to be newly issued. However the pre-emptive rights are granted indirectly as the right to acquire new shares will be allocated among the existing shareholders. The rights shall be traded between April 13, 2004 and April 20, 2004 and exercisable from April 13, 2004 until noon CET on April 21, 2004. The newly issued shares which are not purchased by the current shareholders can be placed by the Board of Directors or by the bank syndicate.

Both its sheetfed offset (+14.5%) and its web and special press division (+17.2%) booked big increases in orders. At EUR 1,231.8m (2002: EUR 1,353.8m), group sales were just 9% below the prior year level. Sales of sheetfed offset presses stood at EUR 617.5m, roughly on a par with 2002 (EUR 619m). This contrasted with a 16.4% drop in web press sales to EUR614.3m (2002: EUR 734.8m). The group order backlog on the balance sheet date of 31 December totalled EUR 856.9m (2002: EUR 832.9m), a 2.9% increase on the previous year. Result: In 2003 the KBA group posted a loss for the first time since 1993. The main causes were the slump in web press sales, currency losses in North America, intense pricing pressures in the market and the heavy costs incurred in downsizing capacity at the group's web press production plants. A EUR 1.9m operating loss and a one-off expense of EUR 45.1m from the closure of two minor assembly plants and redundancies at the main factories in Würzburg and Frankenthal resulted in negative earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of -EUR 46.1m (2002: +EUR 46.3m) and a EUR 49.6m loss from ordinary activities. After factoring in deferred taxes the KBA group posted a net loss of EUR 30m for 2003 (2002: net profit of EUR 28.1m). Earnings per share of EUR 1.75 for 2002 were transformed into a EUR 1.86 loss for 2003. Cash flows from operating activities rose to EUR 61.6m compared to EUR 11.9min 2002. The financial statements for the parent company, Koenig & Bauer AG, which are prepared in accordance with German accounting laws (HGB) and are the basis for dividend payments, showed a net loss of EUR 39.6m (2002: EUR 17.9m profit). So at the AGM on 24 June in Würzburg the management and supervisory boards will announce the cancellation of a dividend payment for the first time since the company went public in 1985. Business operations: Whereas the sheetfed offset division posted an operating profit of EUR 19.9m (2002: EUR 17.4m), the web and special press division returned a loss of EUR 66.9m (2002: EUR 29.2m profit) as a result of the high one-off restructuring expense and severe pricing pressures in the market. Downward adjustment in payroll Downsizing the web press facilities reduced the group payroll by 337 in the course of the year to 7,054 (2002: 7,391) and a further reduction is planned in 2004. Outlook for 2004: Management is confident that brisker sales of web presses and the higher volume of orders on hand in the early months of the current year will help to boost group sales in 2004, while new products slated for launching at Drupa will generate more sales in the short-term sheetfed market in the second half of the year. The group is targeting a return to profitability for 2004, but is unable to estimate the size of potential profits until the summer. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 05.04.2004\",\n",

At the meeting of the Supervisory Board on April 5, 2004, a dividend payout of Euro 0.80 was decided on (previous year: Euro 1.00). This will be brought forward for approval at the Annual General Meeting on June 24, 2004. Cash Flow the same as last year In the financial year of 2003, CeWe Color generated cash flow amounting to Euro 46.5 million, which was almost the same as that of the previous year (- 2.3 %). Earnings before tax (EBT), at Euro 13.2 million, and corporate earnings after tax, at Euro 3.6 million, are 24.6 % and 60.4 % below the figures for the previous year. The drop is mainly due to increases in depreciation (2003: Euro 42.9 million, + 11.4 %). Besides depreciation of fixed assets amounting to Euro 32.8 million, depreciation of intangible assets amounted to Euro 10.1 million in 2003 (previous year: Euro 4.5 million).

While digital products accounted for approximately 8 % of turnover in December 2002, they already accounted for more than 19 % in December 2003.

       " \"CURANUM exceeds 2003 sales and EBITDA targets In the financial year 2003, Munich-based CURANUM AG exceeded its targets for sales and EBITDA. Accordingly, consolidated sales in the period under review rose from EUR 176.7 million to EUR 182.3 million, which was higher than the budgeted figure of EUR 177.0 million. Sales revenues came to EUR 170.2 million (2002: EUR 164.0 million), made up of income totalling 89.5% from care services, 5.4% from the renting of apartments with care services, 3.8% from reimbursements, for instance from incontinence products, and 1.3% from the providing of out-patient care services. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was raised 14.8% to EUR 12.5 million (2002: EUR 10.9 million). The CURANUM Group thus clearly exceeded its officially released target of EUR 12.0 million. In the course of FY 2003, the EBITDA margin improved to 6.9%, up from 6.2%. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 13.4% to EUR 9.8 million (2002: EUR 8.6 million), thus almost attaining the budgeted level of EUR 10.0 million. Consolidated net income for the year stood at EUR 3.6 million (2002: EUR 3.4 million) and fell short of our budget due to a negative financial result of EUR -3.4 million. A higher level of depreciation on financial assets and securities contributed to raising this negative financial result. Earnings per share (EPS) posted EUR 0.12 as compared with the previous year when EPS came to EUR 0.11 (FY 2003: 29,700,000 shares and consolidated net income for the year of EUR 3,554,474.62). In the current financial year, CURANUM AG will continue to pursue its growth strategy, above all through the medium of acquisitions. As the financing options available through banks and the capital market are somewhat limited, there must be sufficient equity available for the purchase of suitable facilities. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board therefore propose to pay dividend in the amount of EUR 0.08 per share for the financial year from the net income available for distribution of the parent company CURANUM AG. This corresponds to a total amount of EUR 2,376,000.00 and a dividend yield of 4%, given a current share price of EUR 2.0. The carryover of EUR 2.5 million is also intended to promote CURANUM AG's goal which is to raise the equity ratio in future in order to realise purchases financed through borrowing, in the medium term as well.

       " 'Nokia expects its first quarter 2004 reported EPS to be EUR 0.17 (meets guidance) and net sales to decline 2% year over year (below guidance) Helsinki, Finland - Nokia today announced that its first quarter 2004 net sales will be below guidance. Nokia\\'s net sales for the first quarter 2004 are estimated to be EUR 6.6 billion, representing a decline of 2% compared to the first quarter 2003 (vs. guidance of up 3 - 7%). The company expects to meet its reported earnings per share (diluted) guidance with the EPS estimated to be EUR 0.17 (vs. guidance of EUR 0.17 - 0.19). Sales of the Mobile Phones and Multimedia business groups were below expectations. Mobile Phones sales declined in Europe and Asia due to lower than expected volumes and a product mix weighted more towards the low end. Due to certain gaps in its product portfolio, mainly in the mid range, the company was not able to fully capitalize on positive market developments. Global mobile phone volume growth is estimated to have been in excess of 25% in the first quarter 2004 while Nokia volumes grew by 19%. Networks exceeded expectations with estimated sales of EUR 1.4 billion, which represents 16% growth compared to the sales in the first quarter 2003. Enterprise Solutions is expected to report sales slightly better than planned. Mobile Phones profitability continued at an excellent level. However, lower than expected volumes and the product mix negatively impacted Mobile Phones\\' sales and operating profit. At the same time, the operating margin of Multimedia is expected to be above plan due to a favorable product mix. In addition to sales, the operating margin of Networks is expected to be healthy and to exceed the company\\'s expectations. The operating margin of Enterprise Solutions is expected to be slightly better than planned. \"Obviously, we are not satisfied with our sales development during the first quarter, but I am pleased that once again we have managed to achieve good, solid profitability. We are particularly pleased with the sales and profitability development in the Networks\\' business. The overall Nokia sales were negatively impacted because we were not able to fully exploit the usual seasonal market pick up in March, and the Mobile Phones product mix was weighted towards the low end. Although we are already starting to see the long-term benefits of the new organization, in the short term its implementation slightly slowed down our reactions and operational effectiveness,\" said Jorma Ollila, Nokia Chairman and CEO. \"With the new organization in place, we will continue to build on our core strengths of brand, demand-supply chain management and cost leadership - while driving further efficiencies in research and development. While our product portfolio in the first quarter was not at its strongest, we believe that during the year we will see improvement as we bring new products to market.\" Nokia will announce the full first quarter results together with the second quarter outlook on April 16, 2004.

However, this was 18% down on the previous year. Before acquisition-related depreciation and stock options, the company's 2003 EBITDA was minus EUR 0.273 million (previous year: EUR 1.607 million). Adjusted for these factors, the operating result was minus EUR 3.183 million and was therefore down on the previous year's EUR 0.097 million. Without taking into account acquisition-related depreciation and stock options, DVFA/SG consolidated result in the review period totaled minus EUR 3.170 million (previous year: minus EUR 3.066 million) and DVFA/SG earnings per share were minus EUR 0.66 (previous year: minus EUR 0.64). After taking into account acquisition-related depreciation and stock options, the figures were as follows: EBITDA minus EUR 0.273 million (previous year: EUR 1.027 million) and operating result minus EUR 4.645 million (previous year: minus EUR 1.944 million). DVFA/SG consolidated result amounted to minus EUR 4.180 million (previous year: minus EUR 4.429 million) and DVFA/SG earnings per share were minus EUR 0.87 (previous year: minus EUR 0.93). In addition to acquisition-related depreciation, the results for financial year 2003 are burdened by other special effects and extensive risk provision totaling EUR 3 million. This is essentially attributable to the following factors: write down of receivables, reserves for the risks and costs of litigation, downward valuation adjustments of inventories, granting a rebate to the contributors of the Mebio/Coripharm group of companies, extraordinary depreciation of land and buildings, provisions for impending losses due mainly to currency risks in our foreign business, and consulting expenses for capital procurement. Thanks to resolute implementation of the restructuring measures initiated, which also involve restructuring and strengthening the sales and marketing segment, there was already a positive trend in the first quarter of 2004. The goal is to achieve the turnaround in 2004. An important prerequisite for doing so is to secure the company's funding. To ensure this, we are currently engaged in discussions with our own banks and with potential financial investors.

The increase of 8.0% against the previous year (249.9 million Euro) is largely attributable to the sales contribution from the sports segment acquisitions made during the financial year (DSF, Sport1, PLAZAMEDIA), which more than compensates for the reduction of turnover resulting from the sale of The Jim Henson Company. As in previous years, the media company's earnings were - aside from ongoing weak market conditions - influenced by special effects. These involved extraordinary write- downs of film assets as a result of impairment tests, as well as one-time charges in connection with restructuring measures (mainly, the sale of The Jim Henson Company and the restructuring of the 400 million Euro 4% convertible bond of 2000/2005). Group earnings for 2003 before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), calculated in accordance with IFRS, totaled minus 11.7 million Euro (2002: plus 8.4 million Euro). Earnings before tax (EBT) amounted to minus 135.2 million Euro (2002: minus 340.2 million Euro). Group loss for the year after shareholder interests stood at 129.9 million Euro (2002: loss of 310.2 million Euro). As expected, individual parent company accounts (in accordance with HGB) show a loss for the year of 171.6 million Euro (previous year: loss of 324.3 million Euro), which is largely attributable to ongoing expenditure related to the convertible bond, and a partial write-down in the value of the shareholding in Junior.TV GmbH & Co. KG. Following finalization at the end of March 2004 of the virtually complete waiver of the convertible bond and the associated far-reaching restructuring of the EM-TV group, EM.TV & Merchandising AG will, within a few weeks, be merged into EM.TV Vermögensverwaltungs AG, to be renamed EM.TV AG.

In the previous year, revenues and EBITA reached EUR 6.6 million and EUR -0.3 million, respectively. The net result for the reporting period stood at EUR -1.0 million, following EUR 0.1 million in the previous year. Despite negative earnings, operating cash flow amounted to EUR 1.4 million in the first half-year 2003/2004 and was thus clearly positive, mainly due to tax refunds. As a result, the liquidity reserve grew by EUR 1.3 million during the half-year from EUR 24.6 million as of 31 August 2003 to approximately EUR 25.9 million as of 29 February 2004. After a satisfactory first quarter, revenues fell, as anticipated, to EUR 2.5 million in the seasonally weak second quarter 2003/2004 (01/12/2003-29/02/2004). The quarter-to-quarter reduction in revenues was partly balanced out by further cost improvements. The EBITA reached EUR -0.9 million, after EUR -0.4 million in the first quarter. In the same period of the previous year, the company showed revenues totalling EUR 3.3 million and an EBITA of EUR -0.2 million. Amid the continued difficulties in the market, the second half-year of 2003/2004, contrary to planning, still shows no sign of revenues or earnings improvement. SinnerSchrader is confident, however, that the restructuring and realignment of the operational business successfully concluded on 1 April 2004 will make the company significantly more dynamic and competitive in the medium term. In the future, IT and agency services will be offered separately on the market by independent divisions. To manage the new business divisions, SinnerSchrader succeeded in recruiting a competent team of executives both from current staff and from our competitors.

       " \"Erste Bank Management Board recommends stock split to AGM The Management Board of Erste Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG announced today that it will propose a four-for-one stock split to the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2004. Since its initial public offering in 1997 the share's performance has been very impressive, with the price rising more than 180% from EUR 44.33 to over EUR 125. The retail strategy embraced by Erste Bank's Management Board is not only confined to its banking business, but also involves encouraging retail investors to participate in its success by buying shares. With this in mind, the Management Board is proposing the stock split in order to make Erste Bank shares more accessible and marketable. To simplify the process by ensuring that the accounting par value of the resulting shares is a round number, the Management Board will at the same time propose a capital increase to the AGM. This increase would be funded from reserves and would raise the bank's called up share capital from the current EUR 435,628,641.82 to EUR 479,550,464. As no new shares would be issued in this capital increase, there would be no dilution to the value of existing holdings. As a result of the capital increase, the amount of Erste Bank's share capital represented by each share would rise from the current level of EUR 7.27 to EUR 8.00. This permits a four-for-one stock split, with each resulting share representing EUR 2.00 of the share capital of Erste Bank. The split increases the number of shares by a factor of four (from current 59,943,808 to 239,775,232) and subject to shareholder approval will be carried out by entry in the Commercial Register at the end of June 2004. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 08.04.2004\",\n",

When making this comparison, however, it must be kept in mind that 55.5 percent of the sales of the Turbon group in 2003 were achieved by subsidiaries in the USA, Great Britain and Thailand, in the relevant local currencies. The fluctuations in exchange rates as compared to the previous year against the stronger Euro have had a negative impact on the Euro consolidation of group sales totaling Euro 12.3 million. Sales of non-impact products (laser cartridges, ink jet etc.) amounted to Euro 97.4 million (p.y.: Euro 101.3 million). This represents a decline of Euro 3.9 million or 3.8 percent, but compared in local currencies, i.e. adjusted by currency effects, we see a 4.7 percent increase. This growth can be attributed to the steadily rising sales of our main product, laser cartridges. Sales in laser cartridges rose from Euro 72.2 million in 2002 to Euro 74.6 million in 2003, which represents a 3.3 percent increase. Taking local currencies as the basis, sales rose significantly by 12.1 percent. The market-related decline in sales of impact products (ink ribbons) continued in 2003 as anticipated. Sales in this area totaled Euro 32.7 million (p.y. Euro 42.1 million). This represents a decline of 22.3 percent or 13.8 percent compared in local currencies. Overall group sales in 2003 are broken down as follows: non-impact products Euro 97.4 million (72.9 percent, p.y. 68.4 percent); impact products Euro 32.7 million (24.5 percent, p.y. 28.5 percent) and other products Euro 3.5 million (2.6 percent, p.y. 3.1 percent). Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted to Euro 6.7 million (p.y. Euro 7.1 million). Due to the steady reduction of liabilities due to banks we were able to lower net interest expenses from Euro 1.5 million in 2002 to below Euro 1.0 million in 2003.

This is clearly a vibrant market that is expanding into new areas and attracting many new users every day. Nokia\\'s own first-quarter mobile device volume growth of 19%, slower than the market, reflected that Nokia was not able to fully exploit the usual seasonal market pick up in March. As a result, our sales for the quarter did not meet our expectations and our mobile device market share declined to 35%, based on our preliminary estimate. However, our long-term mobile device market share target remains unchanged at 40%. Despite Mobile Phones and Multimedia device sales not meeting our expectations, overall we maintained good, solid profitability illustrating the company\\'s ability to manage costs. I am pleased with the strong growth in Networks\\' sales and the Networks\\' operating margin of 12.9%, which reflected the positive product mix as well as the full impact of the restructuring measures taken in early 2003. Our new Enterprise Solutions business group is off to a good start with the success of messaging devices, such as the Nokia 6820. Nokia is committed to maintaining a broad mobile device product portfolio covering products in all markets and most technologies. Our mobile device product plans reflect this commitment to bring competitive products to market in all segments and in a wide range of designs and technologies. We have started to ship six phone models since the beginning of this year, including our first fashion-category fold model, the Nokia 7200. To date this year, we have also launched nine phone models: five with cameras, including our first mega-pixel camera phone; four CDMA phones; and the second generation N-Gage, the N-Gage QD game deck. We plan to have a total of approximately 40 product launches in 2004, with shipments weighted towards the second half of the year. The organizational changes, which we began implementing during the quarter, are designed to increasingly enhance our ability over time to realize the specific opportunities in mobile voice, consumer mobile multimedia and mobile enterprise solutions. At the same time, we expect to improve our research and development efficiency and effectiveness as well as our logistical strength. We are not satisfied with our sales development during the first quarter. I realize that improvements require additional effort and a lot of hard work, but I have confidence in the ability of the Nokia team to address and meet customer needs in all segments by further strengthening our product portfolio.

Adjusted to eliminate currency effects, the decrease in sales amounted to 6%. At EUR 20 mill., the preliminary operating result (previous year EUR 102 mill.) exceeded the forecasted break-even. Cost-cutting and efficiency improvement measures have thus shown their effects earlier than planned. Despite high one-time disbursements for efficiency improvement and restructuring, the free cash flow was positive and therefore much better than forecasted (EUR -100 mill.). Due to high one-time costs, the preliminary result after taxes levelled out at EUR -690 mill., which was in the expected range (previous year EUR -138 mill.). Altogether, the reporting year by the Heidelberg Group was burdened by restructuring costs and expenses connected to discontinued business activities, amounting to roughly EUR 565 mill. The discontinued business activities concerned are Digital and Web Systems. This affected the individual Heidelberg AG financial statement in form of depreciations on financial assets and financial receivables, amounting to EUR 1.2 bill., which are already processed in the group closing.

Danish fruit-juice concentrates and fruit-juice manufacturer Vallø Saft A/S, acquired by AGRANA in April 2003, was included in the consolidated group for the first time. The 13 percent fall in profit from operating activities that was still being predicted after the first three quarters on 30 November 2003 was made up for by a very good last quarter. Improved sales and the continuation of structural and cost optimisation programmes throughout the group had a positive impact on results. Allowing for the fact that some companies had a shorter financial year than in 2002/03, AGRANA was able to match the previous year's excellent profit from operating activities. Profit from investing and financial activities of (6,1) EUR mn was not boosted by any extraordinary proceeds from sales of interests (previous year: disposal of shares in Leipnik-Lundenburger Invest Beteiligungs-AG). Consequently and in the wake of the downward development of a number of Eastern European currencies versus the euro during the preceding 12 months, profit before tax was significantly down on the year. Consolidated earnings for the year did not fall as much because of an improvement in the group's tax position and therefore it was possible to reach with consolidated earnings of 56,5 EURmn the second best result of AGRANA.

The Highlight Group's equity rose by CHF 14.7 million over the previous year to CHF 108.6 million. Including the net loss of EUR 9.9 million sustained by Constantin Film AG, the Highlight Group achieved earnings after tax and minority interests of CHF 10.3 million (previous year: CHF 17.2 million). Accordingly, earnings per share came to CHF 0.22 (EUR 0.14). In fiscal 2003, the Company generated a net inflow of funds of CHF 75.4 million, thus reversing the previous year's net outflow of CHF 24.3 million. Group liquidity (cash, cash equivalents and securities) rose to CHF 167.6 million (December 31, 2002: CHF 72.3 million). On the other hand, there were interest- bearing liabilities of CHF 151.3 million (previous year: CHF 30.1 million).

Incoming orders and sales During the 1st quarter 2004 incoming orders amounted to euro 35.6 million on the basis of preliminary calculations. This represents an increase of 22% versus the corresponding prior year quarter. Sales grew by 25% and amounted to euro 29.3 million during the 1st quarter.

EBIT and income after interest and taxes The key data in respect of the results also clearly increased during the first three months of the new fiscal year. The Board expects profit before interest and taxes (EBIT) of approximately euro 1.8 million. During the corresponding quarter of the prior year EBIT of euro 0.5 million was earned. The income after interest and taxes will amount to euro 1.2 million in the 1st quarter. The result of the full prior year of euro 0.4 million has thus been clearly exceeded already during the 1st quarter 2004.

Quarter and Half Year 2004 Results (ended March 31) SECOND QUARTER RESULTS (January 1 to March 31, 2004) Infineon Technologies AG, one of the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced results for its second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2004, ended March 31, 2004. In the second quarter, the company had revenues of Euro 1.671 billion, an increase of 3 percent sequentially and 13 percent year-on-year. The sequential growth was mainly achieved through a further increase in revenues from the Automotive & Industrial business group, and higher sales volume for Memory Products. The year-on-year increase also reflected significantly improved Secure Mobile Solutions revenues. Sequential quarterly revenue improved despite continued price decline in some product segments, and the negative impact of the weakening US dollar exchange rate. Net income in the second quarter increased to Euro 39 million, compared to Euro 34 million in the previous quarter, and a net loss of Euro 328 million in the second quarter of the last fiscal year. Quarterly EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) of Euro 71 million was comparable to the Euro 70 million in the previous quarter, and showed a substantial improvement from the loss of Euro 221 million in the second quarter of the last fiscal year. The sequential quarterly earnings increase in Secure Mobile Solutions and Corporate & Reconciliation offset lower earnings in Memory Products and Other Operating Segments. The reversal in Corporate & Reconciliation of a Euro 32 million provision for licenses which are no longer required due to a favorable ruling in a legal proceeding, was substantially offset by increased impairment charges, higher restructuring costs and increased provisions for license and legal matters. The year-on-year increase reflected reduced losses in Wireline Communications, and significantly improved profitability for Memory Products and Secure Mobile Solutions. Basic and diluted earnings per share were consistent at Euro 0.05 for the second and first quarter, and reflect a significant year-on-year improvement from a loss per share of Euro 0.45. Infineon's gross cash position, representing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash, amounted to Euro 2.9 billion, increasing sequentially from Euro 2.8 billion. Free cash flow, representing cash from operating and investing activities excluding purchases or sales of marketable securities, significantly improved to Euro 53 million, up sequentially from negative Euro 63 million in the previous quarter.

For continuing activities before impairment and costs related to the efficiency programme, Eurofins\\' EBITDA-margin exceeded 14% and the EBIT for the full year 2003 increased by about 60% to EUR 13.7 million, improving the operating margin to 8% of sales (5% in 2002). After all costs related to the efficiency programme and discontinued activities, the reported EBIT before impairment reached EUR 8.3 million (EUR 8.2 million in 2002). In March 2004, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has published IFRS 3 (replacement of the goodwill linear amortisation plus impairment test by an impairment test only, as it is already practiced under US-GAAP). This new regulation will be applied within the Eurofins Group as of 2003 onwards, since it should allow easier comparability with other listed companies internationally and continuity with future accounts. Eurofins\\' annual net income 2003 according to IFRS reached EUR 1.6 million or EUR 0.12 per share. The cash flow from operating activities increased by over 30% to EUR 15.3 million at the end of 2003 compared with EUR 11.5 million in 2002. As a result, in spite of a high level of investment in infrastructure (EUR 12.6 million CAPEX in 2003), free cash flow after investing activities was positive (EUR 3.6 million) for the first time since Eurofins started its international infrastructure development programme. With a gearing (financial debt net of cash/ equity) of 57% (improved from 68% in 2002), Eurofins\\' financial structure is sound and leaves potential, when and if needed, to raise additional debt financing to fund further growth. The Company intends to further strengthen its balance sheet to prepare for growth. It is planned that fully provisioned earnouts in the balance sheet as of 31.12.2003 representing an amount of about EUR 4.5 million will be contributed as new equity when they come due in June by the creation of 347,616 new shares with an emission price corresponding to the average of the Eurofins share price in the month of May 2004 at Euronext Paris. Further details of this capital increase will be provided with the agenda for the coming shareholders\\' general assembly. During 2004, Eurofins intends to focus on the further successful progress of its efficiency programme, on margin improvements and on further strengthening its relationship with strategic customers.

By comparison with the first quarter of 2003, they were therefore up EUR 1.8 million (previous year: minus EUR 1.5 million). This performance demonstrates that the reorganisation measures LINOS has implemented in the last two years are taking effect.

       " 'TRIA: Preliminary Annual Result 2003 -Comprehensive cost-cutting program was consistently implemented -Operating profit in core segments -Sales on target (Munich, 23.04.2004) TRIA\\'s consistent implementation of a comprehensive program of cost-cutting and restructuring measures throughout 2003 has already delivered results, with initial key corporate figures showing improvement over the previous year. Both the company\\'s core areas, IT-training and IT-consulting, showed a operating profit before extraordinary factors (TRIA IT-consulting GmbH: EUR 1.3 Mio.; TRIA IT-training GmbH EUR 0.3 Mio.) In addition, TRIA succeeded in significantly improving cashflow to EUR 78k in 2003 from EUR -444k in 2002, and bank loans were reduced by one-third to EUR 0.9 m. Liquid funds were equal to the previous year, at approx. EUR 1 m. The company was able to slash operating costs by a total of approx. EUR 4 m by implementing site optimization and capacity alignment measures, bundling activities and functions and creating leaner management structures. The narrower focus of themes and staff adjustments (192 as against 281 employees* as of December 31 in each case) associated with these measures resulted in a fall of sales to EUR 20.5 m over the previous year\\'s EUR 29.2 m, although sales results remained within the planning corridor. The consolidated net loss of EUR 9.7 m for the year (2002: EUR -7.4 m) is principally attributed to extraordinary factors such as structuring costs and depreciations. As a result of accrued losses from the 2003 business year, the equity given in the Annual Report for TRIA IT-solutions AG fell to under half the share capital; the Managing Board will bring this fact to the attention of the immediately convened Shareholders\\' Meeting and present shareholders with a portfolio of appropriate action to strengthen equity levels for TRIA IT-solutions AG. The place and date of the Meeting will be announced in the electronic Bundesanzeiger (Federal Gazette) and in an authorized journal for the publication of statutory Stock Exchange announcements. In the training sector, the comprehensive cooperation agreement concluded with IBM Education Services in June 2003 already generated a plus in bookings for TRIA\\'s Training Centres, and was extended in Q4 to encompass training outsourcing topics. A comprehensive project for an international hardware manufacturer, for which TRIA designed a new training method concept including homogenization and expansion of e-learning activities, won the \"IT Training Award 2003\" on its completion. \"TRIA .NET Services\" in the IT consulting segment proved last year to be a driving force and revenue generator for the consulting segment as a whole. New customers (including an insurance company and an airline) were won and new sectors successfully opened up, e.g. healthcare and the public sector. The cost-cutting program is primarily set to take full effect in the current business year. Given positive developments in the economy, the industry and the market, TRIA is aiming for a significant 5-10% increase in sales, with the objective of a definite and sustained return to profitability - a trend already indicated by incoming orders for the start of the year. *including management/Managing Board and others (freelance staff and staff employed by subcontractors)',\n",

Compared to the same period of the previous year, revenue thus rose by 32.9% (previous year EUR 52.9 million). The growth results primarily from the positive orders position of its core Infocom division. Revenue in Europe during the first quarter came to EUR 64.7 million; in Asia the group earned EUR 6.4 million. The European locations thus posted 35.7% higher earnings than in the reference period. Foreign revenue was about 4.6% below those of last year (EUR 6.7 million). Business at the Asian locations is thus right on schedule, stemming from the project preparation for new bulk orders. These orders were agreed in the first quarter and will go into production in April; thus will only affect earnings as of the second quarter. The Group operating income (EBIT) for the first quarter equalled EUR 7.5 million and thus was 81.4% higher than the previous year's earnings of EUR 4.1 million. From an EBIT margin the previous year of 7.0%, the operating margin in the first three months of 2004 improved considerably to 10.3%. At EUR 6.2 million, pre-tax earnings (EBT) exceeded the previous year's quarter of EUR 2.7 million by 130.9%. The net income for the quarter amounts to EUR 3.3 million. A comparison with the result of the same period the previous year of EUR 1.3 million yields an increase of 160.9%. Based on 37.954 million shares, the net income yields an undiluted EPS of 8.8 cents (previous year: 3.8 cents on 33.72 million shares). The operating cash flow rose by 13.6 percent thanks to the positive earnings for the period, from EUR 9.8 million to EUR 11.1 million. The group was once again able to improve its equity ratio. It improved after the first three months from 43.8 percent to 47.0 percent. Following the complete acquisition of the Balda-Mikron joint venture and holdings of the new partner Everskill, the Board of Directors will raise its earnings forecast for all of 2004.

This is the strongest three-month result since autumn 2000. Operating expenses (1,104m euros) and provision for possible loan losses (238m euros) declined further.

       " \"Munich/Los Angeles, April 26, 2004 - In the fiscal year 2003 the Internationalmedia group generated revenues of EUR 248.3 million. Compared to the year before this is a decline of EUR 11.3 million, which was affected disproportionately by the low US-dollar exchange rate though. On the basis of US-dollars, revenues were increased by 14.6%. The operating result (EBITA) amounts to EUR -19.5 million, which represents an improvement of EUR 9.0 million versus last year. EBITA was affected by the sale of Initial Entertainment Group, Inc. (Initial) which reduced the EBITA of the fiscal year 2003 by EUR 44.5 million. In the fiscal year 2003, due to the cost reduction measures and an extensive emphasis on liquidity, and a concurrent reduction in bank liabilities by EUR 113.3 million, the group was able to generate a positive free cash flow of EUR 78.1 million. However, liquidity continues to be a crucial factor, which is the reason why the group closed a financing with a US-American investor group of up to 18 million US-dollars and a 12 months' term. Apart from reduction of liabilities of the Internationalmedia group this financing will be used for the interim financing of pre-production costs for upcoming film projects, amongst others. The operating result of Initial amounts to EUR -7.1 million (EUR 25.5 million in the year before), while the operating result of Intermedia has improved from EUR -46.7 million to EUR -11.0 million. This makes clear that the efficiency increase of distribution operations as well as the restructuring program have started to take effect. However, the result of Intermedia is still highly influenced by the cash neutral depreciations of former years' project development costs, which amounted to EUR 23.8 million in 2003. The annual net loss is expected to amount to EUR -94.1 million, partially due to the sale of the Initial Entertainment Group, Inc.. Due to the incompatibility of the industry standard US-GAAP with the IFRS, which is applied by the Internationalmedia group with regard to the valuation of its film assets, the auditor for the first time will presumably qualify the auditor's opinion for the consolidated financial statements 2003. The industry standard US-GAAP does not imply the necessity of a correction, while the strict application of IFRS would have necessitated an extraordinary write-off of approximately EUR 7.1 million. Like the year before, for reasons of comparability, the Internationalmedia group has preferred the application of industry standard and thus did not make an extraordinary write-off. Consequently, shareholders' equity of the consolidated financial statements amounts to EUR 59.2 million. The general annual shareholders meeting will be held on July 7, 2004. Due to the ongoing difficult conditions on the international presales markets and the still high depreciation amounts on capitalized project development costs we do not expect a positive operating result for the year 2004. According to the industry standard, depreciation on project development costs automatically affects projects which have been initiated in 2001 but have not yet been greenlit until the end of fiscal year 2004. However, the group will further enhance its distribution strategy and cost structure this year, in order to get back to profitability in the mid-term.

       " 'De facto stock split through planned issue of bonus shares The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of STADA Arzneimittel AG have decided to propose to STADAs Shareholders Meeting on June 15, 2004 that the company double the number of its shares in issue by carrying out a capital increase from its existing funds, issuing bonus shares in the ratio of 1 for 1. By increasing its issued capital stock from EUR 69.4 million to EUR 138.8 million through the issue of approx. 26.7 million new registered ordinary shares, STADA would bring its issued capital stock to approx. 30% and its reserves to approx. 70% of its equity capital, which would remain unchanged at EUR 464.8 million. As far as its stock price is concerned, this capital increase would have the same effect as a 1-for-1 stock split: given that its market capitalization would remain the same, its stock price would be reduced by half for technical reasons because the number of shares would double. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board will also be proposing advance resolutions to the coming Annual Shareholders Meeting that would extend the possibility to buy back up to 10% of STADAs issued capital stock by a further year until 15.12.2005 and increase the companys issued capital stock by up to 50%, reserving the right to exclude shareholders pre-emptive rights, especially for acquisition purposes',\n",

       " \"CeWe Color enhances 2003 operating profit by 5.9 % Oldenburg, April 27, 2004 - CeWe Color Holding AG (ISDN DE 000 540 3901, SDAX) - the largest independent photofinisher in Europe - enhanced its 2003 operating profit (before tax and depreciation on intangible assets) by 5.9 %, from 22.0 million euros to 23.3 million euros. In addition, the corporate group generated cash flow amounting to 46.5 million euros, which is almost the same as last year's level of 47.6 million euros (- 2.3 %). Profits reduced by increased depreciation Earnings before tax (EBT), at 13.2 million euros, and corporate earnings after tax, at 3.6 million euros, are 24.6 % and 60.4 % below the figures for the previous year. The drop in profit in comparison to that of the previous year is mainly due to increases in depreciation (2003: 42.9 million euros, + 11.4 %). Besides depreciation of fixed assets amounting to 32.8 million euros, depreciation of intangible assets amounted to 10.1 million euros in 2003 (previous year: 4.5 million euros). High-margin digital products with high added value Turnover in 2003 in the area of retailing, film development and the sale of conventional prints decreased by 5.2 % to 416.2 million euros as a result of a weak economy and a downturn in the tourism sector (2002: 439.2 million euros). The cost of materials was lowered by 9 %, one reason being the growth generated in the area of high-margin digital products. Costs for staff and other operating costs were cut by 2 % and 0.7 % respectively. The number of staff employed by the corporate group was reduced from 3,977 to 3,907 (- 1.8 %). Expansion of market shares on the European Continent to 33 % In each country, CeWe Color now has an industrial photofinishing market share of at least 30 %, with the corporate group now holding the largest market shares in Central Eastern Europe. The growth-generator: digital photography CeWe Color focused on this area of business last year and was able to offset - or even over-compensate - the decline in the number of colour prints from films thanks to growth generated in the area of digital photography (+ 0.2 % to 3,402 million colour prints). While in 2002 only 38.8 million digital photos were developed, in 2003 this figure had already risen to 170.3 million, a growth rate of 339 %. While CeWe Color digital products and services accounted for approximately 8 % of turnover in December 2002, the digital proportion had risen to more than 19 % in December 2003. The management of the company expects that digital products and services will account for almost 50 % of turnover by 2005. Investments of 40.6 million euros mainly for digital production capacities The strong growth being generated in the field of digital photography has prompted CeWe Color to greatly increase its digital capacities, thus enhancing capital expenditure from 29.5 million euros to 40.6 million euros (+ 37.6 %). Besides increasing the capacity of the networks for transmitting image data in the Internet and extending the Internet platform, all 24 production plants in Europe have been put in a position to supply their regional markets with digital products and services. This investment budget has laid the foundation for extending market leadership in the field of digital photofinishing in Europe. As in previous years, investments were financed solely from cash flow generated. Dividend payout of 80 cents The Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of CeWe Color Holding AG will propose to the Annual General Meeting of the company, to be held on June 24, 2004, a dividend payout of 0.80 euros per share for the business year of 2003. 2004 targets and key data It is not possible to forecast exact developments in the photographic sector at present. We are hoping that 2004 will see a boost in consumption and in particular, recovery in the travel sector. Of all photos taken, 50 % are snapped during holiday trips, and this means that the photofinishing branch is a highly seasonal one. The third quarter is decisive for the amount of annual net profit generated. Due to current uncertainty on how the summer season will develop, the Board of Management is announcing the following key data, intentionally cautious, for the development of CeWe Color in 2004: - Development in volume conventional -8 % to -15 % digital +150 % to +200 % total +/- 0 % to - 7 % - Sales +/- 0 % to - 7 % - Profits Cash Flow 40 to 50 million Euro EBT 10 to 18 million Euro - Investments 30 to 35 million Euro - Dividends 0.70 to 0.90 Euro\",\n",

At 8.7 trades per securities deposit and year, customer activity reached its highest level in two years. Net financial income was EUR 6.777 million (Q1/2003: EUR 7.589 million), within the planned target range. The bank's active sales culture yielded positive results. In the first quarter of 2004, when seven new products were introduced, DAB bank sold products worth EUR 125 million, which represents half the total volume of products sold in the entire preceding year. At EUR 22.967 million, the administrative expenses of DAB bank were 8.7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2003 and 2.2% lower than the comparable prior-year quarter (Q1/2003: EUR 23.495 million). The cost-income ratio was reduced even further to 76.9 % (Q1/2003: 101.8 %). Earnings per share came to EUR 0.08 (Q1/2003: -EUR 0.01). The number of customer accounts carried by the group in the first quarter of 2004 held steady at 461,441, but this number represented an increase of 3,324 customers over the comparable prior-year quarter (Q1/2003: 458,117).

       " \"Frankfurt/Main, 28th of April 2004. In a difficult year for the staffing industry AMADEUS FIRE AG was affected remarkably by a strong decline in the late cyclical market of finance and accounting. While the total temporary staffing industry has to face another 3 percent market decline the group sales of AMADEUS FIRE slumped by 23% to EUR 47,1 millions. Gross profit margin of the total group rose in the last fiscal year by 175 basis points up to 39,5 percent. The increase is caused by higher sales in the training and education business as well as in an improved utilization rate of the temporary staff. Operative result before goodwill depreciation (EBITA) of about Euro 2,0 millions is 57% below previous year. The fourth quarter of the fiscal year did not show a pick up of the business for AMADEUS FIRE-group. Management and supervisory board will propose the shareholders' meeting to distribute no dividend for the last fiscal year as well as to change the fiscal year to the calendar year to achieve a better comparability with the industry. It is expected that the temporary staffing market will slightly pick up in 2004. Temporary staffing in finance and accounting has to be seen as late cyclical and a pick up is not expected until autumn 2004. AMADEUS FIRE-group assumes a slight upswing of sales volumes in the shortened fiscal year 2004. Due to this and the executed cost cutting measures management expects a remarkably improved positive result and intends to distribute a dividend for the shortened fiscal year.

Masterflex AG (ISIN DE0005492938) is continuing its rapid growth. Fiscal year 2003 was even better than expected: revenue increased by 17.8% to EUR66.0 million. Growth in earnings was even more pronounced, with earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) up 37.5% to EUR7.7 million, while net profit soared 48.8% to EUR3.7 million. Earnings per share rose in line with this from EUR0.57 to EUR0.85. The Company had already lifted its targets for full-year 2003 in November 2003, when it was forecasting an EBIT increase of 25 to 30% and revenue of 13 to 15%. Due to the excellent growth, the Board of Masterflex AG will propose an increase in the dividend by 50% to EUR0.60 to the Annual General Meeting on June 9, 2004. Masterflex AG began 2004 well above expectations. According to preliminary data, revenue rose by approximately 38% to around EUR17.8 million. EBIT growth was stronger still: the Company is expecting it to surge by approximately 61% to around EUR2.1 million. This positive development is due to the above-average growth of all business units. Value drivers are the new product campaign, the increasing internationalization of the business, and the acquisition of a large number of new accounts. In addition, the Board of Masterflex AG sees substantial growth potential for the future. However, the Company is initially standing by its conservative forecasts for full-year 2004 (revenue growth of +17 to 20%, EBIT +30 to 35%), despite the surprisingly strong first quarter of 2004.

In 2004, the group increased its turnover by 525 % to EUR 128 million, thereby taking a decisive position in the mobile messaging market in Europe. The group was able to improve its figures significantly; in 2003, a positive EBITDA of 627 k EUR was achieved as compared to a loss of -7 080 k EUR in the previous year. The slightly negative EBIT at -845 k EUR for 2003 also shows a significant improvement on the negative EBIT of -14 781 k EUR for 2002. The main generator of turnover in the past financial year was trade; the highest earnings were achieved by the value-added service area (VAS). The group's orientation towards new and fruitful fields of business and the further expansion into new markets has proved to be the correct path and will be continued in the coming financial years. The sale of securities, whose value in the past financial year was lower than the original purchase price, plus prudent value adjustments in subsidiaries in the USA and Rumania, have had a negative impact on the results to the amount of 1 805 k EUR. This leads to a result from ordinary activities of -3 238 k EUR. Liquid assets totalled up to 1 343 k EUR on 31 December 2003. The VAT tax return receivable from the Steinfurt Tax Authority is still 5.314 k EUR. And, according to the result of the financial audit, no conclusions were drawn that would require adjustments for this claim to tax refund. The equity capital of the company amounts to 9 658 k EUR and the equity ratio improved to 63.45 %. The number of employees is 60 on average, compared to 76 in the previous year. The turnover per employee increased from 260 k EUR in 2002 to over 2 132 k EUR in 2003. The results for 2003 already include expenses for the expansion to new countries such as the UK and Turkey. While the expenditures have had a negative impact on the results in financial year 2003, they ensure the positive development of the group and have already resulted in new orders in the UK and in Turkey in the current financial year.

TELES Group Revenues for the first quarter 2004 showed a marginal increase over the prior year quarter, with reduced earnings. The Management Board considers this to be unobjectionable and maintains its previous growth expectations - particularly as a result of significantly improved order perspectives and an important success at the Federal Patent Court. To begin with, the unaudited IFRS Group benchmark figures for Q1/2004 are as follows: - Revenues: 18.0 MioEUR (17.6 MioEUR in Q1/2003, 2% increase), - Gross Profit: 11.5 MioEUR (10.5 MioEUR in Q1/2003, 10% increase), - EBITDA: 2.9 MioEUR (3.7 MioEUR in Q1/2003, 23% decrease), - EBIT: 1.4 MioEUR (2.6 MioEUR in Q1/2003, 45% decrease) and - EBT: 1.7 MioEUR (3.3 MioEUR in Q1/2003, 48% decrease). The order perspectives just as the launch of the new iXESS VoIP-gateways (VoIP = Voice over IP) indicate that the dent in growth in the TCS segment is only temporary. Also in the VAIS segment - which experienced a positive development in Revenues and Earnings (ignoring the marginal SPC) - measures to accelerate growth have been initiated very successfully: After increasing marketing activities for dedicated servers at the beginning of the reporting period, by its end the promotion program for STRATO-DSL (based on T-DSL) was launched, in a new cooperation with Deutsche Telekom AG. As of March 31st the TELES Group's already excellent Liquidity amounted to 49.9 MioEUR (50.4 MioEUR at the end of 2003) - despite approximately 4 MioEUR in stock repurchases during the period under review, i.e. a total of approximately 18 MioEUR in stock repurchases since Q2/2003 - with continued low liability. By this date, its Equity Ratio remained at an extremely comfortable 60% (64% at the end of 2003) - despite the stock repurchases - with risks on the asset side remaining very low.

Due to a valuation allowance of EUR 23.0 million on deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards, a net loss of EUR 31.3 million was incurred in fiscal 2003 (2002: net income of EUR 12.0 million). Since this valuation allowance is expense-neutral, Dürr shows positive cash flow from business operations of EUR 56.4 million. Earnings per share amounted to EUR minus 2.19 (2002: EUR 0.84). Because of the negative earnings, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Dürr AG will propose to the annual shareholders' meeting that no dividend be paid for 2003. Dürr expects significantly positive earnings before taxes in fiscal 2004, to which the SPRINT SQUARED program will contribute substantially\",\n",
       " \"Müller Weingarten sees signs of an economic spring following a weak year in 2003 Stuttgart, April 29, 2004 In line with the general trend in the international machine tool industry, Müller Weingarten AG - the world's second largest supplier of metalforming plants and systems - experienced a weak year and very mixed developments on the whole in 2003. Consolidated sales fell by 9,4 % to Euro 410.9 million (Euro 453.5 million). The result from ordinary operations exceeded expectations, although the figure of Euro 8.5 million was lower than in the previous year (Euro 12.2 million). The consolidated net income for the year totalling Euro 3 million (Euro 11.4 million) is characterised by reserves for restructuring expenses. The net result of Müller Weingarten AG is balanced by the withdrawal of Euro 2.7 million from the revenue reserves. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will not propose the payment of a dividend for fiscal year 2003 to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. For the current fiscal year Müller Weingarten expects impetus to be generated by activities in Eastern Europe and China. Following a veritable flood of or-ders, the company is looking forward to the future with guarded optimism. However, the high level of order intake in the first quarter will not be reflected in an increase in sales in 2004 due to the long processing times for ordered items. For 2004 Müller Weingarten is forecasting stabilisation in income, so the company expects net earnings to be available for distribution. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 29.04.2004\",\n",
       " \"First Quarter 2004 Report IDS Scheer on Target with Increased Revenues and Earnings -Revenue grows by 41% to 64.6 million EUR -ARIS license revenue up by 59% -International revenues and results more than doubled -Operating profit (EBITA) increases by 26% to 7.3 million EUR -Quarterly profit up 30% to 4.8 million EUR -Substantial consulting projects in the pipeline Saarbrücken, April 29, 2004 In the first quarter of 2004 (January 1 to March 31), IDS Scheer AG again increased sales and results. Worldwide revenue for the IDS Scheer Group increased by 41% to 64.6 million EUR compared to 45.9 million EUR in the first quarter of the previous year. Disregarding currency effects, worldwide growth was 45%. Operating profit before amortization of acquired customer bases (EBITA) outpaced projections, increasing by 26% to 7.3 million EUR (previous year: 5.8 million EUR). Disregarding currency effects, the IDS Scheer Group's EBITA grew by 28% in the first quarter of 2004. In light of the positive trend in the first three months and the number of pending orders, the international business process management solution provider confirms its forecast of 290 million EUR in revenue and an EBITA margin of at least 12% for fiscal year 2004. German and international development The IDS Scheer International segment, comprised of international subsidiaries in 20 countries outside Germany, more than doubled revenue (before segment consolidation) in the first quarter of 2004, increasing revenue by 105% to 37.8 million EUR (previous year: 18.4 million EUR). Without taking currency effects into consideration, international revenue grew by nearly 117%. Revenues posted by IDS Scheer's international subsidiaries increased EBITA by 124% to 2.7 million EUR (previous year: 1.2 million EUR). Disregarding currency effects, EBITA outside Germany grew by 133%. The IDS Scheer Germany segment, which includes IDS Scheer AG as well as the subsidiaries Fact and Radermacher, was able to hold its ground in a continuingly difficult market environment. Revenue of 31.7 million EUR in this segment (before segment consolidation) remained at the level of the previous year (32.0 million EUR). Operating profit (EBITA) in Germany of 4.6 million EUR also held steady at the 2003 level of 4.7 million EUR. Revenue in the Products and Product-Related Services business area grew by 53% to 17.8 million EUR (previous year: 11.7 million EUR), with revenue from ARIS licenses up by 59% to 7.5 million EUR (previous year: 4.7 million EUR). EBITA in this area more than doubled to 5.1 million EUR (previous year: 2.5 million EUR). The EBIT margin increased to 29% (previous year: 21%). The number of ARIS Process Platform licenses, the international leading business process management solution, grew by 24% worldwide to 48,300 licenses as of March 31, 2004 (previous year: 39,000 licenses). Of this figure, more than 3,900 new licenses were purchased in the first quarter of 2004, compared to 2,000 licenses in the first quarter of 2003. Future growth potential is expected from the SAP partnership to integrate ARIS Process Platform in the open integration and application platform SAP NetWeaver, confirmed at the end of 2003. Positive development in consulting and middle market The Consulting area booked positive development in the first three months of 2004 with a steady flow of orders. Consulting services resulted in revenue in the amount of 46.8 million EUR (previous year: 34.3 million EUR) for the IDS Scheer Group, an increase of 37% over the first quarter of 2003. The expansion of the middle market core competency with the new ARIS SmartPath, revenue from which increased by a factor of 3.5 to 5.4 million EUR compared to the same period in 2003, contributed significantly to this growth. As of March 31, 2004, the backlog of orders had grown by nearly 63% to 72 million EUR, compared to 44 million EUR in the previous year. This represents 4.2 months' revenue (previous year: 3.5 months). The chemical/pharmaceutical, paper/textiles, and IT industries, and the public sector experienced particularly strong growth. The IDS Scheer Group counted 1,967 employees worldwide on March 31, 2004, compared to 1,480 at the end of the first quarter of 2003. Of these, 958 employees in Germany and 1,009 employees abroad (previous year: 463) are responsible for the growing number of international clients outside Germany. Results outpace projections Operating profit after amortization of intangible assets (EBIT) in the amount of 0.24 million EUR increased by 23% to 7.1 million EUR (previous year: 5.8 million EUR). Liquidity as of March 31, 2004, was 77.2 million EUR (previous year: 102.1 million EUR). This decrease is to be attributed to the two large acquisitions of mid-2003, which were effected entirely with cash and cash equivalents. Net Profit for the quarter increased by 30% to 4.8 million EUR (previous year: 3.7 million EUR). Simultaneously, earnings per share increased to 0.152 EUR in the first quarter of 2004 (previous year: 0.117 EUR). Outlook In light of the positive developments of the first quarter, the globally strengthened market position, and the number of pending orders, the basis for continued profitable growth has been laid. At the end of April, IDS Scheer received a large consulting order from CIBA Vision, a subsidiary of the US pharmaceutical conglomerate Novartis. Based on an assumed exchange rate of 1.17 USD per EUR, IDS Scheer confirms its forecast of 290 million EUR in revenue and an EBITA margin of at least 12% for fiscal year 2004. In the medium term the Executive Board forecasts a continued growth trend and group EBITA margins of 15% and beyond.

       " \"-Operating profit of 290 million Euro in the first quarter of 2004 more than doubled versus the adjusted Q1/2003 figure - increase in total operating revenues by 2.8 percent -Pre-tax profit nearly quadrupled, to 199 million Euro -Profit of 53 million Euro (previous year: minus 25 million Euro) HVB Group generated an operating profit of 290 million Euro in the first three months of the current fiscal year, more than doubling its performance compared to the adjusted year-earlier level (130 million Euro), despite a persistently sluggish macroeconomic environment. Against the background of a slight increase in operating revenues, this trend is due to significantly lower risk provisioning accompanied by stable administrative expenses. To enhance comparability, the previous year's figures have been adjusted for the current income and expenses of the dis-posed companies norisbank, Bank von Ernst and Bankhaus BethmannMaffei as well as for the effects of the contractual trust agreement (CTA). In addition, the results for the first quarter of 2003 do not include the disposal gains for norisbank and Bank von Ernst. Detailed breakdown of the results Net interest income amounted to 1,285 million Euro in the first quarter, which was 3.7 percent below the previous year's figure of 1,335 million Euro. This figure was not only influenced by the sale of the US real estate portfolio, but also by currency effects resulting from the appreciation of the euro and lower income from our equity holdings after the disposals in the first quarter. In addition, it reflects volume decreases resulting from the reduction in risk assets within the context of the 2003 transformation program, which, however, were offset by margin improvements in the lending business. It should also be noted that net interest income for the first quarter of 2004 does not yet any include any proceeds from the capital increase, which was not completed until early April. At 701 million Euro, net commission income recorded a significant increase of 9.9 percent compared to the year-earlier level of 638 million Euro. This mainly results from higher income in the securities and custody business. The sustained high sales of innovative financial products to retail customers made a particularly strong contribution in this context. Trading profit developed particularly satisfactorily: despite the turbulences in the capital market in the wake of the Madrid terrorist attacks, it rose considerably, to 262 million Euro. This corresponds to an increase of 8.7 percent compared to the already high prior-year level of 241 million Euro. Total operating revenues increased 2.8 percent, to 2,317 million Euro, in the first quarter of 2004 (previous year: 2,254 million Euro). Administrative expenses were stable compared to the first quarter of 2003 (1,549 million Euro), edging down 0.5 percent to 1,542 million Euro. The cost-income ratio improved to 66.6 percent at the end of March 2004 (previous year: 68.7 percent). Risk provisioning declined by 15.7 percent, to 485 million Euro, compared to the prior-year level (575 million Euro). Operating profit more than doubled and came to 290 million Euro (previous year: 130 million Euro). This means that the sustained earnings improvement recorded in fiscal 2003 has continued. At 199 million Euro, pre-tax profit nearly quadru- pled after the first three months (previous year: 54 million Euro). Earnings after taxes came to 111 million Euro (previous year: -5 million Euro). The increase in minority interests in earnings to 58 million Euro is largely attributable to last year's IPO of Bank Austria Creditanstalt. In the first three months, HVB Group generated a net profit of 53 million Euro, compared to a loss of 25 million Euro in the same period of the previous year. 2004 target ranges HVB Group has defined clear target ranges for 2004. The expected first-quarter figures deviate slightly from the pro-rata annual targets, because the effects from the capital increase, which was fully completed in early April, were included in the plans only for the subsequent quarters of 2004. Risk provisions and administrative expenses were comfortably within their target ranges in the first quarter. Operating revenues were still slightly, namely 2 percent, below the anticipated target range. This is mainly attributable to net interest income. The operating profit missed its target range only by a narrow margin. The cost-income ratio was slightly above the envisaged target range. HVB Group initiated revenues-increasing measures in all business segments in the first quarter, which will have a favorable impact on earnings in the coming quarters. HVB Group Target 2004 Targets for January 1 - in million Euro Q1 2004 March 31, 2004 Total operating revenues ¹) 9,600 - 10,000 2,365 - 2,465 2,317 Loan- loss provisions 1,900 - 2,100 475 - 525 485 Administrative expenses 6,100 - 6,300 1,525 - 1,575 1,542 Cost- income ratio in percent 63-65 63-65 66.6 Operating profit in mio Euro¹) 1,400-1,700 315-390 290 ¹) The net-interest-income target for the first quarter of 2004 does not yet take account of the proceeds from the capital increase, which was not com-pleted until early April. Risk assets and capital ratios At March 31, 2004, risk assets compliant with BIS rules amounted to 240.9 billion Euro. This is 0.9 billion Euro less than the level recorded at yearend 2003. Compared to December 31, 2003, the core capital ratio (Tier 1) improved from 5.9 percent to 6.2 percent, and the equity funds ratio rose from 9.7 percent to 10.0 percent. Taking account of the full issue pro-ceeds resulting from the capital increase, the core capital ratio and the equity funds ratio come to 7.2 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 29.04.2004\",\n",

In 2003, revenues totaled EUR 15.5 million, 29% down year-on-year. The main reasons for this were release postponements and sales which did not reach the scheduled level. In the past year, a range of projects was discontinued and sales expectations reduced for games already published. This resulted in non-scheduled write-downs of EUR 7.2 million. In the last year, an EBIT of EUR -10 million was posted (previous year kEUR 624). The net loss of the year was EUR 11 million (previous year: kEUR -185). The balance sheet total declined from EUR 22.8 million in 2002 to EUR 8.1 million in the 2003 financial year. Liquid funds declined from EUR 3.7 million to EUR 1.3 million, with a slight improvement being observed in the fourth quarter. The measures taken in the 2003 financial year for extensive cost reduction and restructuring, which included the release of some 71 employees, were already becoming effective in 2003. However, they will fully impact in 2004. \"In 2003 we had several setbacks. Certain projects could not be realized as planned and sales for games already published lagged behind expectations. However, we are of the opinion that we recognized the situation in due time and have initiated sufficient effective countermeasures to justify a positive outlook for 2004.\" The Management Board end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 30.04.2004',\n",

(previous year EUR 33.8 mio.). EBITDA is EUR 3.0 mio. (previous year EUR 8.5 mio). EBIT is almost equal at EUR -1.4 mio. The group net loss was reduced from EUR -5.1 mio. to EUR - 4.5 mio. Such amount is in 2003 that high because comprehensive depreciations as precautionary measure and receivables which the company considers as uncollectible have been writ off. The new business in 2003 is EUR 13.2 mio. (previous year EUR 32.7 mio.). As of the closing date cash is EUR 0.3 mio. (previous year EUR 0.7 mio.). The equity ratio is almost equal at 15 % at the balance sheet date. The lease contracts at acquisition cost are at EUR 122.5 mio. (previous year EUR 134.2 mio.). Such development has its origin in the slow new business. For the business year 2003 the group expects a substantial improvement of the asset, financial and income situation. In this respect, the company has initiated comprehensive capital market measures. The auditors furnished COMTRADE AG with an unrestricted audit certificate for the financial statement 2003. The management board expects that the current business year will be clearly positive and will lead to substantial profit (EBIT). Therefore, according to IFRS revenues of EUR 35 mio. with a profit of approximately EUR 3.9 mio. (EBIT) are envisaged.

The company was not only able to considerably increase earnings, it also achieved a growth in sales once more. On March 31, group sales had grown by 4.4 % to 23.0 million euros (previous year: 22.1 million euros). This growth was due to an increase in domestic sales.

The company also reported that its Transformation Program, which includes cost cutting and asset sales, is progressing well. Sales Up 6% in Local Currency Terms Sales in the first quarter were 6% higher in local currency terms compared on a like-for-like basis with the same quarter in 2003. The results in Swiss franc terms - up 8% - were helped by positive foreign exchange trends, notably by the stronger Euro. On a continuing basis - which excludes sales for Electronic Materials, a business that is in the process of being sold - sales in the first quarter increased 5% in local currency terms, to CHF 2.086 billion, from CHF 1.945 billion a year earlier. Operating profit grew to CHF 167 million, equating to an operating margin of 7.6%, up substantially from 5.1% on a like-for-like basis compared with the first quarter of 2003. Tight working capital management and the overall strong operational performance helped operating cash flow, which was CHF 104 million in the first quarter, an increase from a negative CHF 152 million in the same period in 2003. Net profit was CHF 72 million. \"We can be satisfied by these results because they demonstrate our ability to increase the top line even as we cut costs across the group,\" said Clariant Chief Executive Roland Loesser. \"While there is still considerably more to be done on our Transformation Program, it is clear that the hard work started last year is beginning to pay off.\" U.S. and Asia Particularly Strong Sales were higher in all five divisions and in nearly all product segments. Growth was stronger toward the latter part of the quarter, with robust demand particularly evident in the U.S. and Asia (11% and 12% respectively, in local currency terms). \"These early signs are positive, but caution is still the order of the day,\" Mr. Loesser said. \"The recovery in Europe continues to be inconclusive.\" Transformation Program Proceeding Well Good progress continued to be made on Clariant\\'s Transformation Program, which includes short- and long-term performance improvement measures and the sales of several businesses no longer central to the company\\'s strategy. As announced in March, two manufacturing plants - in Beverley, England and Knapsack, Germany - will be closed, resulting in the reduction of approximately 200 jobs. The measures are part of a worldwide initiative announced at the full- year 2003 results on 24 February that will reduce 4,000 jobs by the end of 2005. Negotiations continue positively on the sale of several businesses. The company confirmed its overall target to raise approximately CHF 1.5 billion in gross proceeds from the total sales, amounting to 15% to 20% of total turnover. Newly Solid Financial Base The successful increase of the company\\'s share capital - a transaction completed on April 26th - has generated gross proceeds of CHF 920 million, leaving Clariant in a healthy financial position. \"Our improved finances enable us to proceed with the asset sales in a steady and calm manner,\" Mr. Loesser said. \"That means ensuring we get a fair price for these businesses, which are all attractive and have excellent potential in the hands of the right owner.\" Further details on the asset sales will be provided later in the second quarter. The company continues to place a priority on lowering debt, announcing a new target of reducing net debt to below CHF 1.5 billion by the end of the year, from the previous target of CHF 2.5 billion. At the end of the first quarter, net debt stood at CHF 2.901 billion. \"Clariant\\'s transformation will continue to be characterized by tight cost control, broad-based performance improvements and structural changes to enable us to focus on our core strengths in value-adding technology, service-driven businesses and innovation,\" Mr. Loesser said.

       " 'technotrans starts 2004 with Growth in Revenue and Profit technotrans, leading systems supplier of equipment for the printing industry and the manufacture of micro technology, reports a good start into financial year 2004. With revenue up 3.5 percent on the first quarter of the previous year to EUR 26.7 million (previous year: EUR 25.8 million), the positive trend of the previous two quarters held up. The Print segment performed particularly well, growing by more than 11 percent compared with the prior-year quarter to EUR 19.2 million. The efforts to adjust operations during the recent crisis have had a significant effect. For example, the gross margin was boosted from 31.8 to 35.5 percent in the first quarter, and the gross profit rose by 15.6 percent in absolute terms from EUR 8.2 million in 2003 to EUR 9.5 million in the first quarter of 2004. The operating profit, too, improved from EUR 1.3 million to EUR 2.0 million in the first quarter. A net profit of EUR 1.3 million is reported for the first quarter, equivalent to earnings per share of EUR 0.20 (previous year EUR 558,000 or EUR 0.08 per share). Cash and cash equivalents have risen from EUR 8.8 to 11 million since the end of 2003, an increase of 25 percent. Long-term assets in the intangible and goodwill categories fell as a result of amortisation. This amortisation is to be applied for the last time in 2004 as a result of a change in the IFRS accounting provisions, and the result will improve accordingly from 2005. A cash flow from operating activities of EUR 2.4 million (previous year EUR 1.15 million) was generated in the first quarter. After investment, the free cash flow totalled EUR 2.0 million (previous year EUR 458,000). At the reporting date of March 31, 2004 technotrans had a total of 606 employees (previous year: 617. Whereas the total number of domestic employees recovered slightly (421ompared with 403in the previous year), the number of employees abroad was down from 214 in the previous year to 185 on March 31, 2004, largely as a result of the closing of the production plant in England.

With slight increases in unit sales and sales the DEUTZ Group was able to improve its earnings considerably in the first quarter, which is always a low-profit period. New orders rose by Euro 316.0 million to Euro 326.4 million and unit sales by 9.2 percent to 40,109 engines (2003: 36,744). Sales came to Euro 258.8 million, slightly above the previous year's figure of Euro 257.9 million. In the compact engines segment, sales rose to Euro 203.2 million (2003: Euro 191.7 million). In the segment of medium-sized and large engines, sales declined as part of the deliberate policy of concentrating on more profitable applications in the marine sector to Euro 55.6 million (2003: Euro 66.2 million). In the first three months of the current financial year DEUTZ increased its operating profit (EBIT) by 9.6 percent to Euro 5.7 million (2003: Euro 5.2 million).

       " \"Strong growth in sales and earnings in the first quarter 2004 Dusseldorf, May 04, 2004 - The personnel services specialist DIS Deutscher Industrie Service AG showed strong growth in the first quarter. After nine consecutive quarters of year-on-year sales decline, DIS AG's sales increased strongly in the first quarter of 2004 by 14.0 percent to EUR 61.5 million. Organic sales growth was 5.3 percent in the first quarter of 2004, compared with - 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003. The budget figure for the first quarter of 2004 was therefore exceeded by more than 5 percent. This can be attributed particularly to extremely dynamic development in the early- cyclical Industry division and a significantly better than expected start to 2004 for the Finance division. The gross margin developed considerably better than planned in the reporting quarter. While planning assumed a slight decrease in the gross margin due to the increase in the cost of temporary employment associated with the introduction of the collective wage agreement, this increased by 40 basis points to 36.2 percent, an extremely pleasing result. In view of the strong sales growth, the increase in the gross margin, a sound cost structure and the lack of goodwill amortisation, the pre-tax margin was increased onsiderably from 6.1 percent to 9.1 percent in the reporting quarter, which corresponds to an earnings increase of 69.5 percent to EUR 5.6 million. Despite the considerably improved development of earnings, at present DIS AG does not intend to increase its budgeted figures for the 2004 financial year, since this is considered to be premature at this point in time, given the low visibility of temporary employment and the economic uncertainties. Nevertheless, the management views the coming quarters with optimism and continues to assume sales growth of 15.0 percent to EUR 250.0 million and an improvement of 25 percent to EUR 19.3 million in earnings before tax. Earnings per share are expected to increase by 37 percent to at least EUR 0.90 in the 2004 financial year. The full report is available under http://www.dis.ag\",\n",
       " 'Pfleiderer Starts Fiscal 2004 with Improved Sales and Earnings Neumarkt, May 4, 2004 - SDAX-listed Pfleiderer AG (ISIN DE0006764749) started the new fiscal year with improved sales and earnings figures for the first quarter of 2004. The Pfleiderer Group is reporting increased sales for its two Business Segments, Engineered Wood and Infrastructure Technology, which closed Q1 2004 at EUR 242.6 million (2003: EUR 211.4 million). Operative results for Q1 2004 rose to EUR 5.6 million (2003: EUR -0.5 million). Figures up to March 31, 2004 do not include positive effects from the disposal of the Group\\'s concrete and steel towers and poles activities in the USA. This transaction was only legally completed on April 16, 2004. Activities of the US affiliate Newmark International Inc. are therefore included under \"discontinued operations\", as is wind tower production at the steel tower plant in Leipzig. Pfleiderer AG will be disposing of the latter operations during the year. The previous year\\'s figures have been adjusted accordingly. Book profits and income from disposal of Newmark International, Inc. will result in the equity ratio of the Pfleiderer Group increasing from 17.2 percent as of March 31, 2004 to over 20 percent. Net corporate indebtedness, which stood at EUR 260.7 million as of the end of 2003, will also fall to below EUR 200 million. Increases in sales and earnings reported by the Pfleiderer Group reflect positive developments in both its Business Segments, Engineered Wood and Infrastructure Technology. While Pfleiderer Engineered Wood Poland and Pfleiderer track systems made the largest contributions to earnings, Pfleiderer Engineered Wood Germany has also reported noticeable improvements in terms of sales volumes and prices. For Hans H. Overdiek, Spokesman of the Board of Management of Pfleiderer AG, these figures not only reflect more friendly markets during the first months of 2004. They are also evidence of the drive given by our new marketing and sales concepts, now more closely tuned to cus-tomer needs, as well as our tough cost savings package which has been implemented throughout the Group. Looking at the rest of the year, Overdiek remained cautious with regard to market growth for engineered wood in Germany. Here there is still no reliable evidence that demand and prices have improved sustainably. Tight cost management, further improvements to our market presence and customers services, plus vigorous expansion of our international activities remain the primary principles. With this in mind, the Pfleiderer Board of Management is confirming its forecast for current fiscal 2004. Management expects sales volumes to remain stable up to the end of the year, with end-of-year operative re-sults and overall EBT finishing positively.

In the first three months, consolidated sales mounted to EUR 11.2 million (previous year: EUR 12.1 million). The sales decline was due mainly to deconsolidation of the company's interest in IMP Interactive Marketing Partner GmbH as of 1 January 2004. The shareholding was sold to the Scholz & Friends agency group. Like for like, the previous year's high sales level was sus-tained in what tends seasonally to be a rather weak quarter. By increasing its share of the German online advertising market from 12.8% to 14.1% (Nielsen S+P), TOMORROW FOCUS AG was able to improve its market position significantly, thereby con-firming its claim to market leadership. The outlook for the second quarter and, with it, for the first half is most positive. For the first quarter of 2004, the company reports a positive operating result (EBITDA) of EUR 0.2 million after a EUR 0.6 million loss in the previous year. TOMORROW FOCUS AG has accordingly succeeded for the first time in pre-senting positive earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortisation in the seasonally weak first quarter. Last year's consolidation, combined with higher margins in the company's core portal sector and its financial investments, led in the first quarter to a 71% year-on-year increase in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from EUR -1.2 million to EUR -0.3 million. Earnings before taxes (EBT) were up 77% on the year to EUR -0.2 million from EUR -0.8 million and are now only slightly in the red. These figures exceeded markedly the company's expectations for the first quarter. In its core portal sector, TOMORROW FOCUS AG earned EUR 6.5 million in sales in the first quarter, compared with EUR 6.7 million the previous year. The operating result (EBITDA) was increased to EUR 1.0 million (previous year: EUR 0.4 million) and earnings before taxes (EBT) to EUR 0.5 million (previous year: EUR 0.1 million). The shareholdings segment - the company's interests in Playboy and Bellevue - developed extremely satisfactorily, too. Sales were up 10%, due especially to a positive trend at Playboy, to EUR 3.7 million (previous year: EUR 3.4 million). For the first quarter, TOMORROW FOCUS AG was able to report a positive contribution towards its operating result (EBITDA) of EUR 0.4 million (previous year: EUR -0.6 million) and a contribution towards earnings before taxes of EUR 0.2 million (previous year: EUR -0.6 million). The sale of the IMP Interactive Marketing Partner GmbH agency led to a sales decline in the technology segment to a little over EUR 1.0 million (previous year: EUR 2.1 mil- lion). The operating result (EBITDA) in this sector at EUR 0.03 million was, like earnings before taxes (EBT) at EUR -0.07 million, on a par with the previous year. The current quarter shows signs of a brisk demand for integrated, comprehensive communication solutions. Due to seasonal fluctuation, online bookings this quar- ter are running at a markedly higher level than last year. Online advertising orders in hand for the year are currently nearly 100% up on the position last year. Given its optimal alignment and cross-media competences, TOMORROW FOCUS AG anticipates marked first-half growth. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 04.05.2004\",\n",

The key figures at a glance (Q1/03 figures in brackets): Net sales: EUR 19.2 (17.6) million, +9%. Gross profit: EUR 6.2 (4.7) million, +31%. Gross profit margin: 32.3 (27.0) %. The Gross profit margin is still affected by the shortfall in utilization. For the upcoming quarters we expect a clearly improved gross profit margin as a consequence of increasing sales. EAT amounted EUR -5.0 (-5.8) million. Due to not cash effective valuation allowances (EUR 1.2 million) on loss carry forwards there is a low tax rate. With a clearly positive earnings development in the second half of the year this valuation allowance might be withdrawn again. Q1/2004 Order entry reached EUR 24.4 (25.3) million and stayed on the previous quarters' level. In April a significant upswing in order entry was achieved. Thus the management expects Order entry in Q2 to be greater than EUR 35 million. This growth is mainly driven by increased demand for production equipment, for both 200mm and 300mm tools. In participation of this upswing we have already experienced a growth in inventory, which is the primary reason for the reduced Free cash flow of EUR 0.1 (4.6) million. Net cash on hand at the end of Q1 amounted to EUR 25.4 million less EUR 2.9 million short-term bank liabilities.

       " 'Constantin Film now operating successfully again Net income of EUR 1.8 million and positive EBIT of EUR 3.3 million were generated in the 1st quarter of 2004 Constantin Film AG increased its sales by 154% over the previous year to EUR 60.6 million Munich, May 4, 2004 Constantin Film AG (ISIN DE0005800809) achieved sales of EUR 60.6 million in the 1st quarter of 2004 (1st quarter of 2003: EUR 23.9 million). The increase of 154 percent in sales volume by comparison with the previous year is attributable essentially to the consolidation in full of Constantin Entertainment GmbH and the realisation of the free TV sales for Resident Evil. The sales of EUR 8.8 million from theatrical distribution represent 15 percent of total sales and were more than twice as high as in the 1st quarter of 2003 (EUR 4.2 million). Video sales amounted to EUR 4.6 million, an increase of EUR 2.0 million. The Constantin Group recorded sales of EUR 19.9 million with the licensing of TV rights (previous year: EUR 11.0 million); sales with service productions increased from EUR 4.3 million to EUR 22.7 million. Constantin Film AG generated positive EBIT of EUR 3.3 million in the first three months of the current year. This corresponds to an improvement in earnings of EUR 2.3 million over the 1st quarter of 2003 (EUR 1.0 million). The net income for the quarter was EUR 1.8 million after EUR 0.4 million in the previous year. The balance sheet total decreased to EUR 292.4 million on March 31, 2004 (December 31, 2003: EUR 315.9 million), essentially because of the realisation of free TV sales. The equity ratio is 23 percent. If the cash and cash equivalents are balanced with the bank loans and overdrafts and the film assets are balanced with the advance payments received, the adjusted equity ratio is 46 percent. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 72.5 million on March 31, 2004, whereas bank loans and overdrafts were EUR 83.6 million. Net liquidity was EUR 4.6 million higher than on December 31, 2003. For the 2004 fiscal year as a whole, we are working on the assumption that the many years of intensive development efforts and the steady increase of in-house production will be reflected particularly clearly in a strong distribution programme in 2004. We expect our business to be given a further boost by the strengthening of our market position due to the joint exploitation operations with Highlight Communications AG in the video and DVD sector since January 1, 2004 and due to the successful integration of Constantin Entertainment GmbH in the Constantin Film Group. We are therefore planning a considerable increase in sales of over 55 percent to more than EUR 180 million and positive EBIT of at least EUR 6 million in 2004. The complete report on the 1st quarter of 2004 will be available to be downloaded from our Web site http://www.constantin-film.de and the Deutsche Börse Web site http://www.deutsche-boerse.com from May 13, 2004 onwards.

       " 'Novasoft AG discloses its first-quarter 2004 figures · Revenues total EUR 14,500,000, on par with the previous quarter (Q4/03: EUR 14,800,000). · EBIT rose to EUR 899,000 - one-time factors caused a loss of EUR 348,000 to be posted three months earlier. This translates into an EBIT margin of 6.2 percent. · The EBITA of EUR 1,300,000, up from EUR 305,000 as at 31 Dec., 2003, spells a margin of 9.0 percent. · EBT rose to EUR 1,100,000, as compared with a fourth-quarter 2003 loss before taxes of EUR 362,000. The EBT margin thus came to 7.6 percent. · Net income for the period surged to EUR 525,000 from a net loss for the prior quarter of EUR 1,200,000. EPS totaled EUR 0.03, the same figure as for the year-before quarter. · The tax bracket fell by more than half from 92.5 percent to 44 percent. This is the direct consequence of the optimization in Group structure initiated in 2003. The successful impact of the optimization of the Group structure initiated last year was already discernible in first-quarter 2004. By integrating subsidiaries we slashed our tax bracket from 92.5 percent in 2003 to 44 percent. The integration costs were all carried in the books for financial 2003. The organizational inclusion of the subsidiaries has since also been completed. And the Group\\'s structure has been further optimized by our taking over the outstanding shares in the Böblingen-based subsidiary in April 2004. The entire proceeds of said company for business 2004 will be included in the consolidated annual financial statements. Operations in Böblingen will continue as before, meaning that no extraordinary effects will arise as a result of integration costs. Moreover, Novasoft has successfully penetrated the Russian market. With the first complete introduction of \"SAP for Retail\" in Russia, Novasoft has positioned itself at an early date in this fledgling growth market for SAP services as the know-how company. Additional projects are already in the pipeline. Regional revenue trends First-quarter 2004 revenue totaled EUR 14,500,000 and was thus down EUR 1,600,000 on the figure for the year-before quarter of EUR 16,100,000. Compared with fourth-quarter 2003, revenue has, however, held steady and is in line with budgets for first-half 2004. Inside Germany, revenue was on a par with the prior quarter at approx. EUR 5,000,000. Compared with the first three months of 2003, the impact of the weak market is noticeable, with revenue faltering EUR 1,400,000 or by 22.3 percent. Nevertheless, project business with members of our client-base was consistently advanced and in some instances actually broadened. In other European countries, Novasoft scored stable revenue compared with both the prior quarter and on a y-o-y basis, with the figure coming to EUR 8,400,000 (first-quarter 2003: EUR 8,500,000; fourth-quarter 2003: EUR 8,500,000). We identify growth potential above all in Russia. In countries outside Europe, Novasoft achieved an approx. 30-percent increase in revenue on the prior quarter, namely from EUR 924,000 to EUR 1,200,000. Compared with the year-before quarter, revenue (EUR 1,400,000) remained as good as stable. Results EBIT for first-quarter 2004 amounted to EUR 899,000, as against EUR 1,400,000 one year earlier. During the quarter under review, revenues and operating profits were not appreciably influenced by exchange-rate movements. The EBIT margin came to 6.2 percent for the first three months of 2004 and was thus in line with budgets (first-quarter 2003: 8.5%). EBITA totaled EUR 1,300,000, as compared with EUR 1,800,000 one year before, and this corresponds to a margin of 9.0 percent, down from 11.0 percent 12 months earlier. In first-quarter 2004, Novasoft booked EBT of EUR 1,100,000, as against EUR 1,600,000 for first-quarter 2003. Net financial income came to EUR 208,000, up on the figure for the year-before quarter of EUR 194,000. We used forward futures transactions to hedge against exchange-rate fluctuations, and thus generated foreign currency gains of EUR 66,000, as compared with a loss one year earlier of EUR 34,000. Novasoft posted net first-quarter income of EUR 525,000, as compared with EUR 650,000 one year before. EPS ran at EUR 0.03, exactly the same figure as that for first-quarter 2003. High level of order receipts Novasoft assumes as budgeted that the average depth of the order backlog is five months. Inside Germany the Company boasts a fixed order backlog of 4.5 months, in countries outside Europe the figure is 3.5 months and in other European countries it comes to six months. In other words, high-level capacity utilization is ensured for the first half of the year. Outlook \"We are on the right path, not just in structural but likewise in strategic terms. Our greatest growth potential stems from focusing on specific core sectors where we can bring our business know-how combined with our experience in SAP to bear,\" says Dr. Georg Konrad, Member of the Board of Management and founder of Novasoft AG. \"Russia is the most recent example of how successful this strategy is,\" he continued. Novasoft has confirmed its forecasts for financial 2004. From today\\'s viewpoint, management assumes that second-quarter 2004 will see stable revenues and earnings. Should the market pick up, and this is still expected to happen, then we anticipate increased revenue in second-half 2004 and as a result a considerable improvement in the EBIT margin. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 05.05.2004',\n",

The order intake also rose considerably over the previous quarter (Q4/2003 = 69.6 million Euro). The high demand affected primarily prerecorded DVD systems and the recordable DVD growth sector. The order backlog more than doubled from 78.6 million Euro on 12/31/03 to 160.5 million Euro by the close of the period on 03/31/04. At 69.4 million Euro, revenues surpassed the comparable prior-year period (56.9 million Euro = + 22 %). Due to the composition of the order backlog at the end of last year, deliveries and bookings for the first quarter of 2004 were comprised primarily of prerecorded and recordable CD lines. Conversely, the product mix for Q1/2003 was predominated by high-margin prerecorded DVD lines. The change in the product mix resulted in an EBIT decline from the comparable period last year to 4.8 million Euro. This led to a temporary downturn in the EBIT margin to 7.3 %. This will improve significantly in the months ahead. Now the strongest segment, the high-margin DVD prerecorded lines made up approximately 70 million Euro of the order backlog by the end of March 2004. The company continues to give special attention to growth in the DVD and DVD-R markets. The sharp decline in the price of DVD recorders has considerably enhanced the significance of the DVD-R market. Its potential for 2004 is considered to be very positive. Order intake and revenue developments for the first quarter of 2004 reinforce our expectations for double-digit revenue growth in 2004. Since the order backlog has clearly shifted in favour of prerecorded DVD lines, a distinct improvement in the margin is expected for subsequent quarters. The positive mood in the precordable and recordable DVD line market strengthens our conviction that stable annual revenue and earnings developments can be achieved for 2004\",\n",

This represents an increase of 36.8% over the same period last year. In parallel, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose by 57.7%, at an even greater rate than sales, to EUR1.0 million (prior year: EUR657 thousand). The Company is recording its ninth consecutive quarter of continued high earnings increases. Group net income also climbed faster than sales to EUR454 thousand at a rate of 54.4% (prior year: EUR294 thousand). The Managing Board believes that even the most ambitious forecasts have been proven correct and stressed that the thorough preparations undertaken for this leap in sales in all areas of the company were now proving valuable. The Automotive business division driving sales The Automotive business division increased sales by 49.5% in the reporting period to EUR8.9 million (prior year: EUR5.9 million). This represents a share of 66.9% of total sales (prior year: 61,2%). The rise in sales stemmed above all from the air quality sensor line in the product area of air-conditioning systems. In-house developments, as well as the contribution to sales from the takeover of the Bosch division, are reflected in these results. In the business division of Building Technology paragon had achieved sales of EUR146 thousand at the cut-off date (prior year: EUR278 thousand corresponding to a 1.1% share of total sales. The gas detection system Gas Watch Dog(R) is currently undergoing field testing. paragon anticipates rising sales in the Building Technology division.

This corresponds to a 32.0% share of total sales (prior year: 35,8%). Sales of the wholly owned subsidiary Miquest Corp. in Grand Rapids, Michigan, are also included in sales in the Electronic Solutions division. At EUR782 thousand they fell short of last year's sales figures (prior year: EUR1.0 million), but exceeded planned levels for the current fiscal year. The Company is holding fast to planning figures for 2004, which anticipate a considerable increase in both sales and earnings. paragon's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose by 57.7% during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 year on year, and at a greater rate than sales, reaching EUR1.0 million (prior year: EUR657 thousand). This implies an improve- ment of the EBIT margin by 14.7% to 7.8% (prior year: 6,8%). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization improved by 37.5% to EUR1.9 million (prior year: EUR1.4 million).

The Group's cash and cash equivalents rose to a total of EUR3.0 million (Decem- ber 31, 2003: EUR2.5 million). paragon's equity grew to EUR12.8 million in the reporting period (December 31, 2003: EUR12.1 million). Simultaneously, the Company invested a record amount of EUR13.8 million in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the first quarter. This was primarily due to the acquisition of the Robert Bosch GmbH air quality sensor division on January 2, 2004, continued expansion of the Delbrück and Suhl sites, as well as the construction of the new sensor element factory in Suhl. Managing Board confirms the accuracy of 2004 forecasts Based on first quarter key figures, paragon AG's Managing Board confirms the accuracy of the forecasts of approximately 40% sales growth and a significantly higher rise of sales-related earnings for the whole of fiscal 2004. This dynamic growth will continue in the years to come.

Adjusted for consolidation and exchange-rate effects, growth reached around 3 percent. In Property and Casualty insurance in particular, emphasis was placed on profitable growth. A strict underwriting policy and a pricing structure geared appropriately to risk contributed to further improvement in the Combined Ratio - i.e. the ratio of claims and expenses to premiums earned - to less than 96 percent (Q1 2003: 97.7 percent). In Banking Business, which is primarily governed by performance at Dresdner Bank, expenses and risk provisions were significantly reduced.

EUR 8.4m of this related to the fourth quarter (+115%). Consequently the EBIT margin during the fourth quarter stood at 10.6%, and at 8.9% for the full year. AT&S achieved this improvement in the margin thanks to a positive product mix, lower price pressure than in previous year and the success of its cost reduction measures. The earnings before tax stood at EUR 25.2m (+37%), with profits before tax of EUR 8.7m during the fourth quarter (+107%). Net income for the full year amounted to EUR 17.9m, a rise of 104%. Due to the fact that the fourth quarter was far more successful than normal, the earnings for this quarter rose from EUR 0.4m in the year before to EUR 7m. At 0.69%, the 2003/04 earnings per share (EPS) were 108% higher than in the previous year. Thanks to strong cashflows, AT&S was able to reduce its net indebtedness during the financial year to EUR 33.8m, despite the investments necessary to establish the Chinese factory in Shanghai. The debt equity ratio calculated on this basis stood at only 16.6% at the close of the account on 31 March 2004. On the basis of these results, a dividend of EUR 0.24 is proposed to the shareholders' meeting. Thanks to the extremely dynamic market environment and the expansion of capacity, the management is expecting a growth in sales of at least 10% during 2004/05, coupled with significantly higher profits due to improved margins and a falling tax ratio.

Group sales even exceeded the level of the fourth quarter 2003 (EUR 32.662 m) which is traditionally the strongest selling period in the solar industry. In the period under review the group also generated a million EUR result having thus completed the group-wide turn-around. For example, the group increased the net income for the year by more than EUR 2.5 m to EUR 1.473 m (first quarter 2003: minus EUR 1.067 m). Consolidated earnings before tax amounted to EUR 1.819 m (first quarter 2003: minus EUR 1.884 m).

EBITDA (EBIT before depreciation and amortization) ran to EUR 6.939 m (previous year: EUR 1.927 m) thus exceeding the previous year's figure by a large margin. The positive quarterly result illustrates the success of the growth strategy of the solar technology group, which expecting an increasing market demand expanded its production capacities along the entire solar value chain in the past and will continue this policy in the future.

After the first quarter 2004 was heavily overshadowed by the events of the previous quarter the Executive Board expects that the successes of the considerably intensified sales activities will show in the second quarter and that FJH will achieve an at least balanced result in this quarter.

       " 'Major US Agreement 6 May 2004 - DICOM Group plc (\"DICOM Group\"), the global leader in the Electronic Document Capture (\"EDC\") market, its wholly-owned US subsidiary Kofax and Quality Associates Inc. (QAI), a Kofax Certified Solutions Provider, announce that the US Social Security Administration (SSA) has awarded a five- year blanket purchase agreement for Kofax information-capture technology, with a not-to-exceed ceiling value of $20.9 million for Kofax products. QAI will use the Ascent platform and other Kofax technologies to enable the SSA\\'s Accelerated Electronic Disability (AeDib) process to electronically convert vast amounts of paperwork associated with the millions of Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit claims that are filed each year. Once converted to electronic data, paperwork involved in applying for disability benefits can be efficiently stored, retrieved and transferred among processing sites, which ultimately results in accelerated processing of claims. An initial order for more than $3 million has been placed by the SSA for Kofax technology to launch the project. A primary factor in Kofax winning this business was that its flexible Ascent platform was customized to make it the most Section 508-compliant solution currently available (as tested by SSA) in the information capture market. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires that Federal agencies\\' Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) be accessible by people with disabilities. Section 508 requires that an agency procure the most Section 508 compliant product currently available on the market. This award is the first SSA EIT procurement to incorporate SSA\\'s newly implemented Section 508 scoring system, designed specifically to identify the most Section 508 compliant product in the group of tested products that met SSA\\'s business requirements. QAI, a leading provider of technical support services and solutions for both commercial and government entities, customized the Ascent platform by incorporating changes in accordance with the provisions of Section 508 to provide additional accessibility features. The Ascent platform will enable the electronic storage of disability claim information and medical information from claimants, doctors, hospitals and other medical providers, allowing the various decision-makers at the SSA and state-level Disability Determination Services to securely access a claimant\\'s electronic file from a central repository',\n",
       " \"RATIONAL AG: Further expansion at RATIONAL AG - 54 percent growth in North Amerika The weakness of the economy, as well as the launch of a totally new generation of RATIONAL AG products, announced in Europe already in the first quarter, had a negative effect on the business, due to reticence about purchasing on the part of customers. Despite this, the company's sales rose by 5 percent to 45.2 million euros in the first quarter of 2004 (previous year: 43.2 million euros). In fact, currency-adjusted growth stood at 6 percent. The suppressed demand in Europe caused by customers' reticence to purchase in the first quarter has led to a higher level of order intake in April. This means the company is already back in the planned 10 percent growth corridor. In North America RATIONAL grew by 54 percent in local currency terms in the first quarter of 2004. Because of the very high untapped potential, this market is particularly important for the future growth of RATIONAL AG. With subsidiaries in the US and Canada, North America is thus already making a major contribution to the growth of the company. One-off extra costs for fully converting production and preparing for the global market launch of the new product lines had a negative effect on earnings in the first quarter of 2004 of about 1 million euros. Nevertheless RATIONAL was able to further improve its earning power, with earnings before taxes (EBT) of 7.9 million euros, up by 4 percent (previous year: 7.6 million euros). RATIONAL's share price profited, among other things, from positive expectations prompted by the market launch of the new product technology. In the first three months of the year, share rose by 17 percent. At the Shareholders' Meeting on May 12, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of 1.85 euros. This includes an anniversary bonus of 0.45 euros per share to mark RATIONAL's 30th anniversary. Based on the price at the end of the quarter the dividend yield is 3.5 percent. Earnings per share are 0.41 euros for the first quarter of 2004, compared to 0.40 euros in the first quarter of 2003. At the beginning of April RATIONAL presented its completely new technology in Europe - the world's first SelfCooking Center(R). The fully automatic SelfCooking Center(R) is revolutionary in the way it simplifies and streamlines work processes in professional kitchens. All the customer has to do is select the food, and set the desired result, all at the touch of a button. That's it! Traditional settings such as temperature, time and humidity, or complex programming, constant checks and a host of routine tasks are all things of the past. The food is always cooked to perfection - overnight if necessary, and repeatable time after time. RATIONAL has thus once again considerably expanded its technology lead in the thermal preparation of food. Outlook RATIONAL anticipates double-digit growth in sales and earnings for 2004. Based on the business trend in the first quarter of 2004 and the enthusiastic response by customers and the trade press to the new SelfCooking Center(R), management is optimistic that sales of 205 million euros and an EBIT of 47 million euros will be achieved\",\n",

       " \"LEONI reaffirms forecast for fiscal 2004 LEONI AG managed to increase consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2004 despite the persisting weakness of key markets. At EUR 283.8 million, external sales were thus about three above the previous year's figure of EUR 274.7 million. After adjusting for exchange rates, the Company achieved an increase of about six percent. As expected, there was a drop in earnings from continued operations before interest and taxes (EBIT) of about 47 percent to EUR 8.6 million (from EUR 16.3 million in 2003). This is attributable especially to the substantial advance spending for the Wiring Systems Division's large-scale orders. After the successful start of series production for General Motors/Opel in the Ukraine, the main areas requiring capital investment in the first three months of 2004 were the new facilities in Romania and in Slovakia. Production of cables harnesses for DaimlerChrysler's new A-Class as well as for BMW's 1 and 3 Series will start in the course of this year. Earnings in the second quarter of 2004 can also be expected to be well down on the previous year because of further, substantial advance spending in the Wiring Systems Division. A slight upturn is not set to occur until the third quarter, then to be followed in the fourth quarter by a significant rebound as compared with the previous year. For fiscal 2004 as a whole, the Company still anticipates an increase in consolidated sales of about ten percent on the previous year's figure as well as net income of at least EUR 30 million. Although the German automotive industry had to contend with muted demand in the first few months of 2004, the Wiring Systems Division managed to increase its external sales compared with the same quarter of last year (EUR 140.4 million) by almost five percent to EUR 146.8 million. This is due not least to the successful launch of the new Opel Astra, for which LEONI supplies the cable harnesses from the Ukraine. At EUR 1.6 million, the earnings for the first quarter of 2004 were in line with expectations. This significant, 80 percent decline (from EUR 8.2 million in 2003) was due above all to spending on setting up the new facilitates in eastern Europe, where stocks of materials were built up and employees were recruited on a large scale in the first quarter. The underlying economic conditions for the cable industry have changed little compared with the same period last year. Accordingly, the Cable Division's external sales of EUR 113.0 million almost matched the previous year's figure of EUR 114.1 million. In terms of EBIT, the division had to cope with a 25 percent decrease to EUR 6.8 million as compared with the exceptionally profitable first quarter of 2003 (EUR 9.1 million). This is attributable above all to weaker business involving special cables for the capital goods industry as well as an unexpectedly sharp increase in the price of copper in the first two months of the current financial year. The trend of global demand for wire products, especially in China and in the United States, was highly encouraging. As a result, the external sales of LEONI's Wire Division in the first quarter of 2004 came to EUR 24.0 million, roughly 19 percent above the previous year's figure of EUR 20.2 million. This good operating result of the Wire Division was, however, largely cancelled out by costs arising from the shutdown of wire and strand production at LEONI Felisi in Italy. Earnings before interest and taxes thus amounted to EUR 100,000, which equates to a 75 percent year-on-year decrease.

We have seen continued strong interest in our private client advisory product, Brainpower ProActiv(TM), where we signed a further two contracts in the quarter in Switzerland. In the meantime, we have implemented a further cost reduction plan. This is targeted primarily at non-sales related parts of the organisation and we are looking to achieve 1.2 million Euros in annualized savings and expect to see the full impact of the new cost reduction plan in the second half of the year. As part of the cost reduction plan there was a restructuring charge of 92,000 Euros in the quarter.\" Bill Holwell, Chief Financial Officer, added, \"As I have previously stated, the shift by some clients from term to perpetual licenses with upfront fees causes some revenue variability on a quarterly basis.

Cash used in operations equaled 82,000 Euros, down from 1.32 million Euros used in the first quarter of 2003.

At EUR379.1 million, revenues were up by around 8 percent year-on-year (Q1/2003: EUR350.5 million) with net interest income from banking business contributing a further EUR18.6 million. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose by 5.3 percent as against Q1/2003 to total EUR132.8 million (Q1/2003: EUR126.1 million). Segment reporting once again shows Clearstream as the strongest performer, recording revenues of EUR146.0 million (Q1/2003: EUR131.5 million). Revenues were driven up mainly by an increase in proceeds from securities settlement and custody. This result represents the strongest growth recorded by Clearstream since its integration into Deutsche Börse Group. EBIT in the Clearstream segment rose by 24 percent to EUR31.1 million (Q1/ 2003: EUR25.1 million), with costs remaining stable. Revenues in the Eurex segment also increased in the first quarter of this year, rising from EUR104.4 million in Q1/2003 to EUR106.9 million in Q1/2004. EBIT reached EUR53.5 million compared with EUR62.9 million in the same quarter last year.

Revenues in the Xetra segment rose by 42 percent to EUR65.2 million (Q1/2003: EUR45.9 million). EBIT recorded above-average growth, climbing from EUR4.4 million in Q1/2003 to EUR33.8 million. This is due to the 16 percent increase in the number of transactions executed on the Pan-European trading system Xetra, and the increase of approximately 51 percent in the number of transactions executed on the trading floor of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. This means that the investments made in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 relating, among other things, to the introduction of the Central Counterparty for the cash market (\"ECCP\") in April, have paid off. In the Information Technology segment, externally generated revenues fell to EUR31.8 million (Q1/2003: EUR35.2 million), while EBIT reached EUR16.9 million (Q1/2003: EUR24.4 million). The company secured a large volume of new business in Q1/2004, in particular with Deutsche WertpapierService Bank AG (dwpbank), European Energy Exchange AG (EEX) and in the form of project contracts at a number of banks.

Total revenues for the first quarter of 2004 increased 22% to $2.35 million, compared to $1.93 million for the same period in 2003. Sales of spine and orthopedic implants, which include the HYDROSORB(TM) family of products, increased 66% to $1.65 million in revenue, compared to $0.99 million for the same period in 2003. Sales of bioresorbable thin films, which include SurgiWrap(TM), accounted for $0.34 million in revenue, compared to $0.32 million for the same period in 2003, an increase of 6%. Craniomaxillofacial (CMF) products accounted for $0.27 million in revenue from a back-up supply agreement established in September 2002 when the product line was sold to Medtronic, Inc. MacroPore Biosurgery does not expect future revenues under this agreement. Research revenues from a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant totaled $90,000. The increase in revenues for the first quarter of 2004 compared to the first quarter of 2003 was primarily the result of increased surgeon demand for bioresorbable spine and orthopedic devices during the period and the pre-launch of a new system within the HYDROSORB(TM) product portfolio. Historically, the first quarter is the Company's weakest of the year due in part to stocking patterns by Medtronic Sofamor Danek. For this reason, the first quarter is not an accurate indicator of MacroPore Biosurgery's projected results for the remainder of the year. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 was $1.49 million after a one time, $5.0 million gain related to the completion of the Faster Resorbing Polymer study, a milestone under the 2002 CMF product line sale agreement with Medtronic, Inc. Net loss before the one time gain was $3.51 million, compared to a net loss of $3.28 million for the same period in 2003 as shown in the table below (see Explanatory Part).

Within the regenerative cell technology program, research and development expenses increased to $1.464 million for the first quarter of 2004 compared to $0.836 million for the same period in 2003, an increase of 75%. The increase is primarily attributable to expenses related to the engineering of the Company's regenerative cell technology system and expansion of the Company's pre-clinical studies for cardiovascular disease. MacroPore Biosurgery ended the first quarter of 2004 with $15.13 million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments.

Second, there was strong growth in interest income as well as fee and commission income - key revenue streams for us as a retail bank. Finally, in the Austrian business we are seeing further improvement both on the cost and income side, which underlines the effectiveness of the measures launched in the second half of 2003.\" Continuing, Treichl stated: \"We expect the EU enlargement that is now a reality to boost our performance for the full year 2004 and beyond, and believe it will also further strengthen our position as the leading retail bank in Central Europe.\" Note: This quarter saw the first-time application of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) together with IAS 36 and IAS 38. The effect of this change, together with details of other one-off effects are discussed in more detail on the following page. These items combined have no material impact on the Group net profit figure reported for this quarter.

       " 'Nordex performs above budget in the first half year Order receipts up by 16 % / Loss reduced by 57 % Hamburg, May 10, 2004. The preliminary figures for the first half of fiscal year 2003/04 (1.10.03 - 31.3.04) confirm the further stabilisation of Nordex AG operative business. In the first half year the Group received new orders worth EUR 124.4 mn (previous year: EUR 107.3 mn). This represents a year-on-year increase of 16 percent in spite of the fact that Nordex has been applying stricter criteria for recording order receipts since January 1, 2003. Some 65 percent of the new orders relate to foreign projects. Here once again the focus was on the rest of Europe, where the demand for large turbines in particular increased. For example, two Portuguese customers together ordered 24 N90 turbines with a value of EUR 52.7, mn and Siemens Niederlande placed an order for nine N80s worth around EUR 17 mn. As expected, revenues were down in the second quarter. This was due above all to the seasonal drop in domestic business, German industry installing approximately 8 percent fewer machines than in 2003. Nevertheless, at EUR 120 mn, revenues for the half year were slightly above budget. This corresponds to a year-on-year revenue decrease of 20 percent. However, a direct comparison with the previous year is not possible because Nordex has been applying the percentage-of- completion method more restrictively since July 1, 2003. Operating income continued to improve in the second quarter of 2003/04. Over the half year losses before taxes and interest (EBIT) decreased by 57 percent to EUR 12.5 mn (previous year: EUR 28.8 mn), a better performance than planned. The main reason for the improved earnings is to be found in the decline in the cost-of-materials ratio to approx. 82 percent (previous year: 87.7%). The balance from other operating expenses and earnings fell by some 44 percent, personnel expenditure by 19 percent. The number of employees at reporting date dropped by some 19 percent to 721 (previous year: 887). Nordex was free cash flow positive the third quarter (+ EUR 4.2 mn). The improved operating result can be attributed to the restructuring program introduced in the summer of 2003, around 70 percent of which Nordex has now implemented. The key focuses of this program are the optimisation of business processes and radical cost cutting on the basis of technical and commercial measures. In the current financial year Nordex still expects a loss before taxes and interest totalling EUR 28 mn. A return to profit territory is planned for fiscal year 2004/05. Note for analysts and the press: At the international telephone conference scheduled for 10:00 h (CET) today Thomas Richterich (Spokesman for the Nordex AG Management Board) will explain the preliminary figures for the first half of 2003/04.

Parsytec AG, the world\\'s leading supplier of surface inspection solutions for strip products, announces its results of the first three months of the financial year 2004 as of 31 March 2004.

This development is attributable to the company\\'s plan, begun in 2003, to maximize investment of the current business income into the development of strategic product and market position. Revenue & order entry slightly down in the first quarter Revenue and order entry dropped slightly in the first quarter, to EUR 6.4 million (-6 %) and EUR 5.0 million (-5 %). The result of the first quarter of 2003 included a one-time effect in the form of three block orders for steel and paper, so that relative to that revenue and order entry declined by 25 % and 46 %. Increased efficiency provides a basis for strategic product introduction For five quarters, the company has invested heavily in the new product Parsytec 5i, for which also marketing began at the end of the first quarter. This was made possible by a considerable increase in efficiency, resulting in a gross margin of 55 %, liquid assets of EUR 14.1 million and an equity ratio of 79 % in the first quarter (Q1 2003: 49 %, EUR 12.2 million, 72 %). After the product was first announced on 5 March 2004, on a worldwide \"5i-Roadshow\" 19 management meetings were held with potential customers. A positive feedback turned out from these meetings, for the productivity gains first time made possible by 5i through the simple and comprehensive use of all surface quality data. 2004 outlook unchanged: flat business trend, 5i provides basis for 2005 As announced for 2004, Parsytec expects order entry and revenue to remain at about the previous year\\'s levels, as positive (steel consumption) and negative market factors (the raw materials crisis) are expected to more or less balance each other out. By investing heavily in the further development and rollout of Parsytec 5i, the company aims to further strengthen its competitive position, and to return to significant growth in 2005 and the following years.

Most notable is the marked improvement in consolidated net results from EUR -1.1m a year earlier to EUR 1.2m. Pre-tax profits reached EUR 2.1m (EUR -2.0m) for the financial year to-date. In EBIT terms, results were also considerably higher than originally expected at EUR 0.04m (from EUR -4.3m). Earnings per share were EUR 0.12 (EUR -0.10). Synthesis Division reports dynamic growth Sales revenues in this segment continued to accelerate during the current financial year to reach a level 346% up on a year earlier. Indeed, sales of EUR 7.3m in the first two quarters nearly equalled revenues for this segment during the entire course of the previous financial year as Sanochemia's synthetically produced APIs again proved to be a major source of group finances. The positive segment operating result of EUR 4.0m (from EUR 0.2m a year earlier) demonstrate that this field remains the group's most profitable segment and are indicative that the potential of innovative future developments, such as exclusive synthesis contracts for major pharmaceutical players, is far from exhausted. In the course of its diversification strategy, Sanochemia will also be promoting the development and production of generics and fine chemicals. This operational area will offer new markets and contribute towards corporate results. Human Pharmaceuticals Division with moderate rise in sales revenues Divisional sales rose 7% during the first half to EUR 5.5.m. However costs, including those linked to registration and licensing efforts, weighed heavily on the segment operating result, which fell to EUR -0.9m (from EUR -0.8m). The founding of a US subsidiary is progressing rapidly such that Sanochemia products (e.g. an HIV 2 test) are expected to shortly be vying for a slice of the US market. Research & Development Sanochemia's most notable achievements with R & D projects during the first half were the successful conclusion of the clinical trial into post-operative delirium and the completion of the preparatory work necessary for the first regulatory filings for the muscle relaxant tolperisone (SPH 3047). Outlook On the basis of progress made in advancing existing projects and favourable order forecasts, Sanochemia expects the current trend to continue in the second half. The Board is therefore confident that the guidance released at the beginning of the financial year, sales revenues of EUR 24.0m and a break-even, will be attainable or marginally exceeded.

The main reasons for this superior performance: cost reductions and efficiency enhancements from restructuring the business operations and last year's disposal of loss-making operations. On a quarterly comparison, the EBIT margin climbed from 2.2 to 3.9 percent. Rheinmetall's Q1/2004 EBT jumped by EUR 11 million to EUR 14 million while net income at EUR 12 million was easily above the Q1/2003 EUR 2 million.

Most of the retrenchments are the consequence of restructuring programs in Germany and Italy. This successful start into 2004 by the Kolbenschmidt Pierburg Group represents the continuation of organic growth and further advances in operating profitability. Assuming that the global economy and automobile demand both develop at a steady pace, the Group expects to close 2004 with earnings in excess of 2003.

All divisions contributed toward the Group's EBIT, a major share in the earnings rise being shown by Pierburg through higher sales, a superior product mix and more competitive cost structures. The Pistons division's EBIT was also clearly up by an adjusted 27.8 percent, the Plain Bearings division raising its EBIT by a steep 28.9 percent thanks to the successful restructuring of its American subsidiary KS Bearings.

From January to March 2004, the company reached an EBIT* (pre-goodwill and exceptionals) of Euro 198 million, 52 percent above the figure disclosed for the same period of 2003 (Euro 130 million). In the same period, revenues grew by 9 percent to Euro 6 billion. EBIT* improved in all Divisions but Aeronautics. Defence contract and Space turnaround execution are on track. Self-financed Research & Development (R&D) has continued at the same pace, namely for the A380. CEOs: \"Results confirm our 2004 targets\" The EADS CEOs Philippe Camus and Rainer Hertrich said: \"The first quarter results confirm our targets for this year. For the medium-term, we are increasingly confident in our growth prospects - we notice further improvements in the civil aviation market, which we expect to speed up further in 2005. And our defence businesses will continue to increase their contributions. We are exceptionally well positioned to fully benefit from the expected upturn. EADS is on track to reach new levels; all businesses have achieved breakthroughs: A380 first assembly has started; defence businesses are reaping the benefits from cross-business synergies and from transatlantic alliances; in Space, we are building a profitable business that contributes across the portfolio.\" Net Cash position increased Cash was mostly generated by the stronger EBIT* and working capital improvement. Free Cash Flow before customer financing surged to Euro 419 million (Euro -309 million for the first quarter 2003). The Net Cash position increased from Euro 3.1 billion at year-end 2003 to Euro 3.4 billion as of 31 March 2004.

According to these new rules, goodwill amortization, amounting to EUR 85.8 million in the first quarter of last year is no longer required.

After taking the current economic conditions into consideration, the first quarter of 2004 developed positively for Data Modul. Revenues of 31.6 million euros were achieved (compared to 28.4 million euros last year), which represents an increase of 11.3 %. The amount relating to display technology accounted for 89 % (85 % last year) of the total. Remarkable is the proportionally larger increase in order entry, with a growth of 45.9 % over last year. The surge of incoming orders totalling 41.3 million euros, and the resulting high order backlog of 75.0 million euros as of 3/31/2004, represent a good basis for revenues for the coming months. Due to the shift in product mix with the portion of multi-media business increasing to about 12.9 %, EBIT, according to U.S.-GAAP, dropped to 1.0 million euros (from 1.1 million euros last year). The earnings per share developed analogous to the operating results, reaching 0.17 euro per share, or 17.9 % under last year's 0.21 euro per share. Further, not all products were able to get delivered on time, as increasing global demand in the multi-media segment lead to supply problems for various purchased components. The present component shortages also influenced our market segment for airport information systems, which uses to some extent the same components as in large screen monitors.

       " 'Quarterly sales in target range - 70% increase in orders The first quarter of the 2004 financial year of init innovation in traffic systems AG was marked, on the one hand, by further successes in international tendering and, on the other, by a continuing reluctance of local public transport companies in Germany to invest. These contrasting developments resulted both in an increase in incoming orders by more than 70% as well as in a drop in sales as at the balance sheet date compared with the previous year. Thus, at first glance, sales at init AG in the first quarter of 2004 seemed significantly less than in the comparatively strong previous quarter (5.5 million Euro), recording a mere 3.6 million Euro. However, it should be noted that, for many years, only around 10% of total annual sales have on average been attributable to the first quarter. Thus, the sales figure for the first quarter of 2004 is well within the target range of the projected estimate of 33 mil- lion Euro for the overall year 2004. By the end of March, init had also recorded incoming orders of around 6.4 million Euro, which is more than 70% above the figure for the comparative prior- year period (2003: 3.7 million Euro). Thus, the orders on hand as at the balance sheet date had increased to 39.0 million Euro (2003: 30.6 million Euro). In sales, the strategically planned internationalization led to disproportionately rising costs. At the same time, the share of hardware supplied in the majority of the large-scale projects currently implemented turned out to be less in this phase. This resulted in the sales revenues and in the gross profit. The hardware deliveries will now be effected in the coming months. Thus, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) as at the end of March stood at -2.2 million Euro (2003: -0.9 million Euro). The consolidated deficit reached -1.4 million Euro, after -0.5 million Euro in the comparative prior-year period. Therefore, the net earnings per share in the first quarter amounted to -0.14 Euro (2003: -0.05 Euro). Despite individual positive signals in the German market, the domestic business remained at a rather low level, recording sales of 0.9 million Euro (2003: 2.7 million Euro). The Managing Board therefore reacted by introducing a number of cost savings measures. These measures include the closure of our branch offices in Berlin and Essen as well as an adjustment of our workforce. Based on the high level of orders on hand and the increasing hardware deliveries for major projects in the USA and Europe over the next few months, we anticipate a positive business trend in the course of the year and are confident that we will reach our growth targets set for 2004. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 12.05.2004',\n",

Net income before taxes at the international financier of commercial real estate amounted to EUR 55 million in the first three months, compared with the pro- rata prior year figure (1/4 of 2003) of EUR 39 million (+41 %). Adjusted by the exceptional income item generated in the prior year as a result of buying the WestHyp minority shares (\"Lucky Buy\"), the improvement in net income before taxes was 83 %. Consolidated profit improved to EUR 41 million from the pro-rata prior year figure of EUR 29 million (+41%). Quarterly earnings per share are stated as EUR 0.31 (pro-rata 2003: EUR 0.22 per share). The earnings situation improved in all three business segments of the group, whereby most of the growth in earnings was attributable to Hypo Real Estate International. Compared with the pro-rata prior year figure of EUR 22 million, net income before taxes in this segment has more than doubled to EUR 46 million, one reason being the initial incorporation of the US real estate financing portfolio which was acquired at the end of 2003. The segment Württembergische Hypothekenbank experienced the accustomed sound development in business, and achieved net income before taxes of EUR 16 million in the first quarter (pro- rata 2003: EUR 13 million). As expected, the scheduled down-sizing of the domestic loan portfolio had a negative impact on operating revenues in the segment Hypo Real Estate Deutschland. Quarterly net income before taxes in this segment amounted to EUR minus 1 million (pro-rata 2003: EUR minus 3 million).

Gross margin percentage was up both year on year and on Q4 2003 at 42.8% (Q1 2003: 42.3% excluding Allasso; Q4 2003: 41.0%) primarily resulting from the increase in the mix of revenue towards higher margin services.

This result underlines the forecast for Group net income of just under EUR 100 million for 2004. Compared with the first quarter of 2003, Aareal Bank further enhanced its capital base and continues to demonstrate stable growth. At the same time, thanks to the reduction of some EUR 1 billion in risk-weighted assets, the core capital ratio improved from 7.4% to 7.8%. Aareal Bank consequently achieved a significant improvement in results in qualitative terms, and was also able to sustain the excellent overall result that it achieved in the first quarter of 2003. The international property financing portfolio increased by 6.1% in the first three months of the current year to EUR 12.1 billion, after EUR 11.4 billion for the corresponding quarter of 2003. The German portfolio was down by a net 1.8%, even taking into account new lending commitments. International lending accounts for a 52% share of the lending business in Aareal Bank Group's book, and for as much as 70% of the commercial business. First quarter new business, which generally tends to be more subdued compared to subsequent quarters, climbed 42.8% to a good EUR 1 billion compared with EUR 0.7 billion for the first quarter of 2003. New commitments outside Germany, which accounted for just under 90% of this figure, underline the international focus of Aareal Bank's lending business.

Q1 results 2004: Increased Revenue and Positive EBITDA Veldhoven, The Netherlands, 13 May 2004 Teleplan International N.V. today announced its results for the first quarter of 2004. These results show a slow turnaround after still some turbulence and performance interruptions. Revenue in the first quarter amounted EUR 70.8 million (2003 Q1: EUR 69.7 million), a nominal increase of 1.6%. At a constant US dollar rate revenue would have been EUR 77.2 million, which represents an increase of 11%. In this case each of the regions would show a solid increase in revenues in the first quarter of 2004, compared to the first quarter of 2003 (EMEA Region +14%, Americas Region +5% and Asia Pacific Region +28%). Similar to the last quarter of 2003, the operating income before amortization and depreciation (EBITDA) was slightly positive in the first quarter of 2004 with EUR 1.2 million (2003 Q1: EUR 7.0 million). The operating income (EBIT) amounted minus EUR 2.0 million (2003 Q1: EUR 3.2 million positive). The net debt position (interest carrying debt after deduction of cash and cash equivalents) increased to EUR 52.0 million from EUR 39.9 million per 31 December 2003 (2003 Q1: EUR 65.9 million). The increase mainly stems from net working capital movements and the deferred payments related to the 2003 restructurings program. The cash from operating activities in the first quarter of 2004 amounted to EUR 11.6 million negative (2003: EUR 16.8 million negative). The net cash position increased from EUR 22.4 million per 31 December 2003 to EUR 28.0 million per 31 March 2004 (2003 Q1: EUR 16.1 million). In the first quarter of 2004 Teleplan has been awarded business with total annual service revenue valued at approximately EUR 7.5 million per annum, generally consisting of smaller business awards (EMEA: EUR 3.5 million, Americas Region: EUR 2.8 million and Asia Pacific Region: EUR 1.2 million). In the same period Teleplan lost business with annual service revenue of approximately EUR 17 million (mainly in the EMEA region), predominantly caused by lower volumes. The business wins in the first quarter have declined in comparison to 2003, which was a relatively strong one in this respect. As a result hereof the elimination of underutilization has become more difficult. One of Teleplan's major challenges for 2004 will be a further enhancement of the profitability of the existing contract base\",\n",

In the same period, Group net income (including special effects caused by, amongst others, the discontinuation of scheduled goodwill amortization in accordance with IFRS and the release of provisions for patent disputes) increased by +23% to EUR 15.3 million (Q1 2003: EUR 12.4 million). Quarterly earnings per share reached EUR 0.57 (Q1 2003: EUR 0.62); the average number of shares outstanding was +33% higher due to the approx. 6.7 million new shares issued in connection with the capital measures in autumn 2003. Earnings before taxes (EBT) for the first quarter of 2004 were EUR 24.1 million (Q1 2003: EUR 21.7 million), or +11% higher than the corresponding previous year figure. EBITDA improved by +7% to EUR 36.4 million (Q1 2003: EUR 34.1 million). STADA achieved these good results despite the anticipated health care policy challenges in various national markets. This applies particularly to Germany, where the law on modernizing the public health care system (\"GKV- Modernisierungsgesetz\" or \"GMG\") came into effect at the beginning of 2004. The resulting advance effects at year-end 2003, as well as uncertainties of doctors and patients, in part due to a lack of complete implementation regulations, have also influenced STADAs performance in the German market at the beginning of 2004. Furthermore, some of STADAs products are heavily affected by mandatory discounts granted in favor of the public health care insurance system. However, Group sales in Germany increased by +6% to EUR 103.1 million in the first quarter of 2004 (Q1 2003: EUR 97.5 million). At the same time, STADAs increasingly international orientation is paying off. International Group sales increased by +19% to EUR 99.4 million in the first quarter of 2004 (Q1 2003: EUR 83.7 million), representing 49.1% of total Group sales. STADAs Executive Board believes that the Group will continue to successfully meet the current health care policy challenges.

Revenue was boosted by 31% compared with Q1/2003, from EUR 24.8 million to EUR 32.4 million. Over 10% of this growth is organic (previous year 8%).

Earnings per share (pre-goodwill) rose by 30% to EUR 0.28 (previous year: EUR 0.22). Due to the consolidation of companies acquired in mid-2003, Möller Medical and Ned Air, the increase in revenue for the year will be around 15% instead of 30%. However, EPS will rise disproportionately thanks to the relative improvement in the finance result and the absence of start-up costs. The first quarter figures are in line with this year\\'s forecasts (revenue of EUR 130-135 million, EPS pre-goodwill of EUR 1.30-1.35). In particular business related to low-energy construction methods like heat recovery systems for indoor air systems and the plastic gas flue systems were again able to report very good growth in revenue and earnings. In the \"Medical Technology & Engineering Plastics\" division, the new area of medical technology in particular made a substantial contribution towards earnings. Start-up costs for the technically successful large-scale production start of high-strength, super-lightweight composites diminished earnings only slightly. The positive mood in the market for environmental products is strengthening the company\\'s conviction that CENTROTEC\\'s revenue and earnings are on track for the remainder of 2004 thanks to its decision to concentrate on sustainable products reflecting the long-term growth trends of health, comfort and energy.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose from EUR12 million to EUR72 million and in the case of earnings before interest (EBT), the MAN Group achieved a turnaround from minus EUR31 million to plus EUR32 million. MAN Group after-tax earnings amounted to EUR21 million after minus EUR19 million in the same quarter last year, while earnings per share reached EUR0.13 after minus EUR0.14. The major manufacturing companies in the MAN Group were responsible for this improvement, especially the Commercial Vehicles Division which reported a marked swing of EUR46 million in both its EBIT figure of EUR29 million (2003: -EUR17 million) and in its EBT of EUR10 million (2003: -EUR36 million). With the exception of Further Industrial Holdings and Financial Services whose earnings more or less equalled the 2003 figures, the remaining MAN divisions reported percentage EBIT and EBT increases in the single-digit range. Reaching EUR3.7 billion, order intakes exceeded the figure for the comparatively weak first quarter of 2003 by 23%. This growth resulted partly from a revived lively inflow of major orders, but also from a marked 15% increase in new orders for on-going operations. MAN Group sales increased by 8% to almost EUR3 billion. Based on economic forecasts, the encouraging developments during the first three months and the continuing higher level of incoming orders in the manufacturing divisions in April 2004 compared with the previous year (+24%, MAN Group including Services +9%), our expectations for the year 2004 continue to be generally positive. We are counting on a marked increase in order intake and sales compared with 2003 (order intake EUR13.7 billion, sales EUR13.5 billion). The good performance recorded in the first quarter, the order intake during April 2004 and a positive order trend during the first few days of the drupa trade fair have strengthened our conviction that we will achieve our internal goal of earnings before taxes in the region of EUR400 million (2003: EUR261 million), provided that economic trends remain positive.

Otto Christian Lindemann, Spokesman of the Management Board, expects the current year to be difficult overall, but is optimistic that the company will reach its targets for the 2004 financial year.</P> <P align=left>Flensburg, 13 May 2004</P> <P align=left><BR>The Management Board</P> <P align=left> <TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=323 border=0 x:str> <COLGROUP> <COL width=116> <COL width=114> <COL width=93> <TBODY> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle width=116 height=17> million</TD> <TD class=fontstyle width=114>3 months 2003</TD> <TD class=fontstyle width=93>3 months 2004</TD></TR> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle height=17>Sales</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>71.4</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>79.0</TD></TR> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle height=17>- Retail</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>17.3</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>20.4</TD></TR> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle height=17>- Mail order</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>31.6</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>36.2</TD></TR> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle height=17>- Wholesale</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>17.1</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>17.5</TD></TR> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle height=17>- Entertainment</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>5.3</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>4.8</TD></TR> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle height=17>EBIT</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>6.2</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>7.2</TD></TR> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle height=17>EBT</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>5,6</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>6,6</TD></TR> <TR height=17> <TD class=fontstyle height=17>Period income</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>3,6</TD> <TD class=fontstyle>4,6</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE> <P>&nbsp;</P> <P>Please click here for further information:</P> <UL> <LI><A href='http://beate-uhse.mae-b.ws/beate-uhse/ir/publications/DE0007551400-Q1-2004-EQ-E-00.pdf' target=_blank>Interim Report&nbsp;(PDF, 466 KB)</A> <LI><A href='http://beate-uhse.mae-b.ws/beate-uhse/press/18108.html'>Press Release</A></LI></UL> <P>&nbsp;</P></SPAN> <P>Please click here for further information:</P> <UL> <LI><A href='http://www.beateuhse.ag/english/ir/publications/DE0007551400-Q2-2004-EQ-E-00.pdf' target=_blank>Interim Report&nbsp;(PDF, 466 KB)</A> <LI><A href='http://beate-uhse.mae-b.ws/beate-uhse/press/19179.html'>Press Release</A></LI></UL> <P>&nbsp;</P></SPAN>\",\n",
       " 'ACG announces results for the first quarter 2004 Wiesbaden, 13.05.2004. ACG Advanced Component Group AG (SDAX), an independent supplier of technology and logistics service company for the semiconductor industry, announces today the results for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2004 which ended on March 31. The Company achieved sales of EUR 26.5 million during the period under report. Sales were thus 39% lower than those of the prior year period. It must, however, be taken into consideration that certain CPU transactions were undertaken during the first quarter of the prior year, which have now been discontinued by ACG. The planning for the first quarter had targeted sales in the amount of EUR 25.0 million. ACG was thus able to exceed its plan by approximately 6%. EBITDA amounting to EUR -0.6 million was still negative. It could be improved slightly in comparison with the prior year. Also the EBIT (EUR -0.8 million) could be improved (prior year: EUR -0.9 million). The Board of ACG is satisfied with the development of the gross profit margin. During the first quarter 2004 this amounted to 13.8% and thus reflects the positive development in the market for semiconductor components. With 13.8% ACG not only already exceeded its own objective (13.0%) but also increased the gross profit margin of the fiscal year 2003 (10.2%). The liquid assets amounted as at 31.03.2004 to EUR 16.6 million (status as at December 31, 2003: EUR 18.0 million). ACG expects additional positive funds inflow during the next few months from the various divestments of companies and other measures during 2003 and 2004. These funds should be used to finance the expected growth in 2004. The equity ratio of the ACG Group increased to 60,9% as at March 31, 2004. As at December 31, 2003 this still amounted to 59,9%. The number of employes as at March 341, 2004 was 215. Within the context of the current cost reductions at the ACH holding company the objective is to reduce the number of employees to under 10. For the total ACG-Group we expect an increase of the number of employees during this fiscal year especially in sales. The discontinued operations registered a loss in the amount of EUR 1.3 million during the first quarter 2004. The companies, Logos Smart Card A/S and Bluefish Technologies AG were also managed in this sector. The divestment of these companies was announced on March 31, 2004. Taking the discontinued operations into consideration the net result of the first quarter amounted to EUR -2.5 million. \"The divestment of Logos / Bluefish was concluded and we have now achieved the turnaround at AZEGO Technology Services\", according to Dr. Boersch. On the whole the ACG Group is maintaining its sales target for the fiscal year 2004. \"It is our objective to increase the gross profit margin to approximately 13% in 2004\", said Dr. Boersch. \"During the next few months it will also be shown that the high administration cost can be reduced and that the one-time effects of the discontinued operations will be ended.\" The operating company of the ACG Group in Munich (AZEGO Technology Services GmbH) achieved a breakeven result during the first quarter 2004. The loss reported by the ACG Group is thus exclusively attributable to the charges of the discontinued operations and the expenses of the ACG holding company. During the last few weeks AZEGO Technology Services has opened additional new sales offices. Already at the beginning of the year locations in Shanghai (PR China) and Vienna (Austria) were integrated into the AZEGO network',\n",
       " \"GRENKELEASING AG: 23 percent profit increase Baden-Baden, May 13, 2004: GRENKELEASING AG's earnings before interest, taxes and valuation of financial instruments (EBIT) rose by 52 percent from EUR 6.4 million to EUR 9.8 million in Q1 of this year. However, due to IAS/IFRS accounting, the company posted a valuation expenses balance of EUR 1.7 million on its financial instruments. GRENKELEASING AG thus achieved earnings before taxes (EBT) of EUR 8.1 million in Q1 2004. This means an increase of 27 percent against last year's comparable of EUR 6.4 million. After-tax profits increased by 23 percent to EUR 4.8 million (compared to EUR 3.9 million in Q1 2003). As already reported in advance, the company's new business (i.e. the total acquisition costs of newly purchased leased assets) rose by 16 percent in Q1 2004, increasing from EUR 75 million in 2003 to its present level of EUR 88 million. The margin of new business (contribution margin1), from which the financial result over the life of a contract is derived and which is thus a key profitability indicator, grew superproportionally in Q1 2004 to a level of EUR 10.0 million against last year's comparable of EUR 7.9 million, representing an increase of 26 percent. IFRS earnings per share rose year-on-year from EUR 0.29 to EUR 0.35. The full three months report for 2004 is available under http://www.grenkeleasing.de Investor Relations - Figures.

       " \"AMB Generali makes a good start in the business year 2004 - Group profit rises to EUR 53 m - Above-average premium growth for life/health insurers - Investment result improves by EUR 836 m - Full-year profit of more than EUR 200 is realistic The AMB Generali Group succeeded in maintaining the continuous upward tendency already initiated in the past business year. With a net income of EUR 53 m (previous year: - 87m) and an above-average growth in life and health insurance, the third-largest primary insurance Group in Germany made a good start in the first quarter of the current business year. As a whole, the development of the first three months confirms that the AMB Generali Group is well on track for achieving a consolidated net income after tax of at least EUR 200 m in the current business year. Life and health insurers are the growth pillars The life and health insurers of the AMB Generali Group kept expanding their excellent position in the German insurance market. In life insurance, total premium income went up by 7.5 percent to EUR 1,802 m. A decisive element in this development was a positive new business of regular-premium policies which experienced a 59.7 percent growth to EUR 349 m. To a considerable extent this is attributable to the markedly rising demand for products of old-age provision and to the one-off item caused by the first increase step of the so-called Riester contracts. In addition, the positive trend of stock markets led to a substantial recovery of the market of unit-linked life products. The pension- scheme company AMB Generali Pensionskasse, founded about 18 months ago, took out more than 25,000 contracts in the first quarter 2004 representing premiums for the total policy duration of EUR 937 m. In private pension business with a state incentive, the Group's life insurers succeeded in maintaining their leading position in the market by concluding about 27,000 new Riester contracts. A decisive contribution to this successful new-business development is attributable to Deutsche Vermögensberatung, the long-standing distribution partner of the AMB Generali Group. Health insurance also experienced an increase of gross premiums written by 10.7 percent to EUR 373 m mainly as a result of good new business and due to premium adjustments. In the wake of a more restrictive risk selection in motor business and the withdrawal from industrial business, the property and casualty segment posted a 5.1 percent decrease of premium income in direct business to EUR 1,360 m. As a whole, in the first three months of 2004 the total premium income of the AMB Generali Group increased to EUR 3,540 m (preceding year: 3,499 m), despite the pruning of portfolios. Without the savings portions of unit-linked life insurance and Riester contracts, gross premiums written under IFRS accounting amounted to EUR 3,278 m (preceding year: 3,271 m). Strong increase of investment result A major contribution to the quarter's profit was made by the strong increase of the investment result, which reflects the marked improvement of stock markets in comparison to the previous year. Net investment income went up by EUR 836 m to 811 m, thus returning to profitability. This is also to the benefit of the customers of the AMB Generali Group's life and health insurers: claims and benefits rose by EUR 897 m to 2,643 m. The by far biggest share of this increase is attributable to the provisions for premium refunds. Decrease of tax charge In addition to the markedly improved investment result, the reduced tax charge also had a positive influence on the Group result. The tax expenditure decreased to EUR 66 m. In the first quarter 2003, based on the tax rules for life and health insurers still applicable in that period, the tax charge had amounted to EUR 235 m. Improvement in underwriting business The positive development in the first three months of 2004 is supported by the continued structural measures taken to increase the profitability of underwriting business. Already at year-end 2003, the combined ratio had been reduced from its 2002 level by 10.7 percentage points to 99.5 percent. A further improvement of the combined ratio of claims and expenses of the AMB Generali Group is pursued primarily by prudent risk selection in motor business and the withdrawal from industrial business, which is proceeding as scheduled. As at March 31, 2004, the Group had a combined ratio of 98.4 percent. Due to extraordinary items in 2003, that latter percentage compares to the ratio of the first quarter 2003 to a limited extent only. In last year's first quarter, the restructuring of the reinsurance programme and the partial run-off of reinsurance treaties had led to an extraordinarily low combined ratio of 93.8 percent, which then gradually increased in the further course of the year as these effects levelled off. The ratio of 98.4 percent as at March 31, 2004 is in line with our target of reaching a combined ratio below 100 percent in the current business year. The cost-reduction programme already initiated last year is being continued in the current business year. In order to increase profitability, total expenses across all lines of business are frozen at the previous year's level. The planned cuts of a total of 1,250 job capacities in administrative services by year-end 2005 are proceeding as scheduled. By the end of the quarter, about 870 jobs had already been shed on a national level, of which more than 100 in the first three months of 2004. As already announced, another 300 jobs will be cut in the Group in the current business year. Positive outlook for the business year 2004 For the current business year, the AMB Generali Group expects its life and health insurers to reach an above-average growth. In property and casualty insurance the continued measures for improving the portfolio quality will lead to a decrease of premium income. The development of the first three months confirms the prognosis made at the beginning of the year. The Group thus expects to achieve a profit after tax of at least EUR 200 m for the year 2004, provided that the current year will not be affected by extraordinary claims and negative developments of capital markets.

Stuttgart, May 13, 2004 - In the first quarter of 2004, CENIT continued its positive development and posted a Group-wide profit at the start of the year for the first time in its history. CENIT has, therefore, not only confirmed its steady performance in the divisions Product Lifecycle Management Consulting, Outsourcing Services and Document Management Solutions, but also decisively and sustainably expanded on its trend. For the coming months, CENIT expects the trend in earnings and sales to remain favorable. Although hardware sales continue to decline, CENIT has managed to increase consulting business by 28%. An EBIT margin of 4.2% underlines this trend. This margin was at minus 2.9% as recently as last year. Compared with the first 3 months 2003, CENIT saw incoming orders rise by 14% to EUR 27 million in the first quarter 2004. As at 3.31.2004, the volume of orders in hand totaled EUR 24 million, up 30% on the previous figure. Consolidated sales at CENIT reached EUR 14.45 million (2003: EUR 15.74 million/- 8%). By contrast, Group gross profit rose 10% to EUR 10.98 (2003: EUR 9.99 million). A clear signal for the continuation of the positive trend in the consulting business. EBITDA for the Group amounted to EUR 0.78 million (2003: EUR -0.25 million/412%). For the first time since the founding of the Group, first quarter EBIT is EUR 0.60 million in the black (2003: EUR -0.50 million/220%). Group EBT was at EUR 0.61 million (2003: EUR -0.54 million/213%). Group EPS amounted to EUR 0.12 EUR (2003: EUR -0.13/192%) undiluted. Group cash flow from operating activities totaled EUR 2.17 million. The Group's total assets fell from EUR 24.29 million to EUR 20.67 million. The equity ratio improved from 41% in 2003 to 51%. At the end of the period under review, equity was at EUR 10.61 million (12.31.2003: EUR 10.06 million). Short-term borrowings from banks include only a goods financing loan of EUR 1.31 million (12.31.2003: EUR 3.25 million). At 3.31.2004, cash and cash equivalents totaled EUR 9.13 million (12.31.2003: EUR 7.15 million). CENIT remained on a successful course in its core market of Germany and posted sales of EUR 14.15 million (2003: EUR 15.21 million/-7%). EBITDA climbed to EUR 0.87 million (2003: EUR 0.75 million/16 %). EBIT again rose by 47% and reached EUR 0.72 million(2003: EUR 0.49 million). EBT stood at EUR 0.73 million (2003: EUR 0.49 million/49%). The improved orders situation and the consistently positive and solid earnings situation allow CENIT to look forward optimistically to the rest of the year. This improvement is evident in CENIT customers' increased consulting requirement for product development and manufacture and for business process optimization solutions. CENIT is responding to this increasing volume of orders with a targeted expansion of its workforce\",\n",
       " \"IM Internationalmedia AG announces figures for the first quarter 2004 Munich/Los Angeles, May 13 2004 - The Internationalmedia group generated revenues of EUR 30.8 million in the first quarter of 2004, due in large measure to overages from TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES. Although this represents a decline of EUR 49.8 million from the previous year it must be noted that the first quarter of 2003 saw the theatrical release of four Internationalmedia films while none were released in the past quarter. The continuing high depreciation of previous film development costs, which do not have an impact on liquidity and will presumably be significantly lower after 2004, amounted to EUR 4.4 million negatively impacting the period's results. Actual film development spending for the first quarter amounted to only EUR 1.6 million. Overhead costs, EUR 3.4 million for the first quarter also showed a positive reduction of EUR 1.3 million from a year earlier. Overall there was a negative operating result (EBITA) of EUR -5.0 million. Primarily due to the sale of the Initial Entertainment Group, the equity ratio of the group improved to 22.0 percent from 16.9 percent and bank liabilities were reduced by EUR 82.1 million. Because of the cost reduction measures the company group generated a positive free cash flow of EUR 12.8 million in the first quarter 2004. The recent financing of 18 million US-dollars with a private US-American investor group was not closed until April and, therefore, its positive effect in not reflected in this first quarter statement.

The Jenoptik Group completed the first quarter of 2004 with a clear increase in sales, operating and net income for the period in year-on-year comparison, and new record figures in order intake and order backlog. The Jenoptik Group saw an increase in sales of 10.5% for the first quarter of 2004, with group sales totaling 290.7m euros (1st quarter 2003: 263.1m euros).

Starting in the middle of this year, Quelle will offer its customers a custom long-distance plan, \"powered by 3U\". The plan will offer preselection long- distance service specifically tailored for Quelle customers. 3U will take care of all the operational aspects of the service. Thanks to this project, 3U expects a significant increase in revenues and profits in the second half of 2004, after a weak start into the first half-year. During the first quarter, 3U could not reach the usual strong margin level. The restructuring for the integration of OneTel once again affected the profits. In addition, the launch of new Products was delayed because of technical difficulties with an equipment vendor. According to preliminary data for the first quarter of 2004, this, along with the cleaning of OneTel\\'s customer portfolio, lead to revenues than will likely be significantly lower than projected. As a result, the profits for the first quarter of 2004, which will be published in detail on 5/17/2004, will be lower than expected. The very promising cooperation, however, should significantly increase revenue, and help to compensate for the delay in the realisation of the planned measures. Near the end of the second quarter, 3U will be in a position to launch further new products and services to increase organic growth.

The Group\\'s liquid funds as at 31.03.2004 amounted to EUR 2,634,000, an increase of EUR 1,392,000 or more than double the figure as at 31.03.2003. The improvement in the cash flow position was primarily attributable to the favourable business development in both segments of net AG, the effect of previous improvements in cost structures at the individual companies and the capital increases implemented at net mobile AG. Based on the slowly improving order book situation in the middle of the third quarter in the Information Technology segment, we look forward optimistically to the current second half-year for this division. In the area of Communications Technology the favourable development of net mobile AG is likely to be disrupted in view of differentiated reporting in various media. In the opinion of the Management Board of net AG and net mobile AG, however, this is merely a temporary phenomenon. On the basis of this assessment, we expect the favourable dynamic that is the hallmark of the Communications Technology Division to resume in the fourth quarter. Working on this assumption we stand by net AG\\'s planning. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 13.05.2004',\n",

In the same period last year, tax effects dragged the earnings down, making for a loss before income taxes in QI 2003 of -324 thousand EUR. Meanwhile, revenues declined in QI 2004 to 5,102 thousand EUR (from 5,622 thousand EUR in QI 2003). The reduced revenues - especially in the first two months of 2004 - can be attributed to the disappointing state of Alphaform's main markets. Despite the continuing subdued business climate in the target markets - especially the automotive industry - Alphaform achieved a positive cash flow from operating activities of 87 thousand EUR. By comparison, QI 2003 saw a negative cash flow from operating activities of -715 thousand EUR. Cash and cash equivalents including short term investments were up slightly from 10,160 thousand EUR at 31 March 2003 to 10,189 thousand EUR at the reporting date. Alongside ongoing activities designed to cut overheads, a program of measures to enhance performance throughout the group has been developed in response to the intensified pressure on margins. The main goals of this performance enhancement program are to exploit markets better, to reduce product costs and overheads, and to optimise processes covering the group as a whole. Given current forecasting uncertainty, the company forbears at present from publishing detailed forecasts of turnover and earnings for the current year.

During the first quarter of 2004, GERICOM AG, which is listed on the SDAX, returned to profitability. As the figures published today reveal, the mobile computing und consumer electronics specialist recorded sales revenues of EUR 113.1 m (2003: EUR 125.0 m) and a positive operating result (EBIT) of EUR 1.86 m (2003: EUR 4.85 m). The Home Entertainment segment, which was only launched a few months ago, made its first major contribution to sales with revenues of around EUR 15 m. At the same time, the inventories of EUR 94.7 m at the end of the 2003 financial year were cut to EUR 57.5 m, so that the company now disposes of sufficient liquidity again. As a consequence, equity was raised from EUR 56.96 m at the end of 2003, to EUR 59.27 m. The equity quota was therefore up at 39.0% (31.12.2003: 28.83%) In addition, order backlog as at March 31, 2004, showed solid development. With EUR 37.8 m (2003: EUR 59.6 m) this represents an excellent platform for the sustained, operative success of the company in 2004. Following this positive start, the company assumes that seen overall, the 2004 financial year, which will primarily be characterised by consolidation processes, will prove successful. Accordingly, the Managing Board anticipates a profit for the year as a whole. The complete quarterly report is available on the company website and can be accessed at http://www.gericom.com',\n",

This transaction, which is expected to be completed in June 2004, will enable Micronas to further expand its comprehensive TV system solutions portfolio. The purchase price of approximately USD 26 million will be paid in cash and Micronas\\' shares. Chicago-based LINX Electronics employs a highly acclaimed HDTV technology team of about 20 engineers and brings complementary technology to Micronas. The purchase includes all development activities and patents held by LINX Electronics. \"With this acquisition we have taken another decisive step forward in our digital TV business, strengthening our position in the TV market and providing increased value and services for our customers,\" said Micronas\\' vice president consumer products unit, Hans-Juergen Désor. \"Our existing strength in Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) technology, combined with the expertise gained with this acquisition, puts us in the excellent position to shape the era of global migration from analog to digital TV.\" \"HDTV is a reality now! Our technology enables an exciting new TV experience,\" explained Wayne Li, co-founder of LINX Electronics. \"As part of the Micronas Group, we will be able to better serve these markets by offering manufacturers innovative and comprehensive system solutions for their future applications.\" Since the late 1980s, the global economic superpowers have been in a race to bring digital TV to the consumer market. Three international standards have been created: US-ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee), Europe-DVB (Digital Video Broadcast), and Japan-ISDB (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting). The US is currently the largest HDTV market, with deployment accelerating due to a phase-in plan mandated by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requiring TV manufacturers to integrate digital TV tuners into nearly all their TV products by 2007. LINX Electronics has developed a breakthrough ATSC compliant receiver technology that delivers superior reception to more consumers. Typical applications include HDTVs, set-top boxes, personal video recorders (PVRs), DVD recorders as well as PC tuner cards.

This compares to gross revenue of EUR 36.4 million for the same period of last year. In what is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year, the company thus achieved an increase of 13.2%. A total of 19 wind turbines with a rated output of 30.0 megawatts were installed in Germany in the first quarter of 2004. This compares to 18 turbines and a rated output of 25.0 megawatts for the same period of last year. Nine turbines affected revenues in the reporting report. Ten other turbines are part of a portfolio which is offered to the purchaser of a major project from 2003 (41 wind turbines which were sold in December of 2003). The first quarter traditionally is the weakest quarter of the year. Due to the low gross revenue, EBIT was EUR -3.3 million, compared to EBIT of EUR -1.2 million for the previous year. Earnings after tax in the first quarter of 2004 amounted to EUR -2.3 million. This compares to earnings of EUR -1.1 million in the first quarter of 2003. Earnings per share were EUR -0.43 (2003: EUR -0.20). As of May 12, REpower Systems AG received EUR 10 million as a subordinated loan from a bond issue (PREPS) managed by HypoVereinsbank. REpower intends to ask the annual general meeting on June 9, 2004, to convert this into a dividend right. Order backlog as of the end of March 2004 includes purchase orders for 263 wind turbines with a total rated output of 454.4 megawatts. These customer orders are generally subject to conditions precedent such as building permits and financing. REpower expects 96 of the 263 wind turbines to be built in 2004. Furthermore, the consolidated holding company Denker & Wulf AG expects to implement projects with an additional 40 wind turbines in 2004. Taking into account the orders that are currently under negotiation, REpower assumes that it will be able to achieve its annual target of 190 turbines in 2004. The international business of REpower Systems AG has developed successfully. REpower Systems AG will implement a number of international projects as early as the second quarter of 2004. A few days ago, six MD77 turbines were shipped to Japan, two more have already been ordered and will be shipped in the next months. In April, REpower delivered three MM82 turbines to the Ribamar wind park in Portugal. A further nine turbines have already been ordered. REpower will erect a total of 18 turbines in Portugal this year. There are also existing projects in France and Cyprus, which will be implemented later this year. In the period under review, REpower Systems AG was able to enter into a framework agreement with SIIF Énergies, an affiliate of the large French power company EDF. REpower has attained the status of \"Preferred Supplier\" and will therefore submit tenders for almost all projects planned by SIIF. The first projects under this framework agreement are expected this year. REpower assumes that it will be able to surpass at least its target of 50 turbines in international markets.

The Dürr Group's gross margin improved in the first quarter of 2004 to 17.3 %, while having amounted to 16.1 % in fiscal 2003. Earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased to EUR 16.3 million from EUR minus 0.1 million in the previous year's period. With consolidated net income of EUR 2.2 million (first quarter of 2003: net loss of EUR 8.4 million), earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.16 (first quarter of 2003: EUR minus 0.59). The earnings improvement is primarily attributable to the SPRINT² earnings enhancement program. Dürr was able to raise consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2004 by 21 % to EUR 486.7 million (first quarter of 2003: EUR 403.8 million). The increase is primarily the result of completing a large contract in North America. Consolidated incoming orders in the first three months of 2004 amounted to EUR 415.1 million and thus returned to a normal level, as expected, after the extraordinarily high previous year's figure of EUR 1,123.8 million. For the full year 2004, Dürr expects earnings before taxes above the figure achieved in 2003 before restructuring expense (EUR 18.7 million). The SPRINT² program is expected to contribute substantially to the earnings improvement. The financial statements for the first quarter of 2004 have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. In an internal review, Dürr has determined that order-specific receivables were valued too high, and accruals too low, in the financial statements for the first quarter of 2003. It has subsequently adjusted the affected items in the statements of income for that quarter. The adjustment has no effect on the consolidated financial statements dated December 31, 2003, because the presented earnings effects reversed themselves in the subsequent quarters\",\n",

However, the results for Q1 2003 included an interim payment for a major project which alone amounted to EUR 1.3 million. Without this payment the revenues were comparable in both quarters. The costs of IVU were considerably lower in a year-on-year comparison: personnel costs alone were down EUR one million or 19 percent for Q1 2004 on the figures for Q1 2003. As a result of this, the EBIT improved by 33 percent to EUR (1.6) million, and the consolidated losses by 32 percent to EUR (1.7) million. \"Gratifyingly, the figures for the first quarter show that the restructuring measures introduced a year ago are already beginning to take effect.\", commented Prof. Ernst Denert, the Chairman of the Management Board of IVU. The company is now running a much leaner operation as far as costs are concerned. This means that with a conservatively estimated turnover in the current year forecast at almost thirty million euros, IVU will already be operating in the black again regarding EBTDA. \"The first quarter figures do not provide a basis for any predictions about the overall performance for the financial year, because we traditionally generate up to half our revenue in the last quarter, but I am optimistic that we will reach our goals this year\", assured Denert. Regarding its liquidity planning, this meant that at the end of March it was possible for IVU to make the scheduled initial loan repayment of EUR 1.5 million. IVU has no longer activated performances in Q1 2004 from the development of software, in contrast to Q1 2003, when more than EUR 0.4 million was activated. In past years, there were high-levels of activated performances, in particular for the development of the software platform for public transport. But these investments are beginning to pay off, and the systems are successful on the market. However, the sums left to be written off are still impacting on the results. IVU is the only system developer currently able to offer its customers an IT platform of software and hardware solutions for all public transport requirements.. Our systems are used by more than 300 transport utilities world- wide. Once again in the first quarter, IVU was able to win numerous new customers.

In the Presentation and Media Technology business segment, where a comprehensive package of measures is currently being implemented in order to adjust the segment to the drastically deteriorating market conditions, the restructuring measures that have been introduced have begun to show their first positive effects. Nevertheless, net sales of 20.8 million euros fell considerably short of the previous year's net sales (25.2 million euros).

The shares have already been placed by the VEM Aktienbank AG with institutional investors at a price of EUR 1.25 per share. This corresponds to a total placement value of EUR 3,875,000. The capital increase is being recorded in the Commercial Register at the Ebersberg local court and the shares admitted to trading on the stock exchange at short notice. Following this capital increase, the Company's shareholder equity now amounts to EUR 34,450,000, divided into 34,450,000 shares. MWG Biotech AG thus strengthens its equity base and creates extra leverage for financing future growth. The Management Board plans to use the available additional cash for financing a project for the development of a new synthesizer technology. With this new technology MWG Biotech will not only extend their quality leadership in the area of synthetic nucleic acids, but also defend their cost leadership in the production of these high quality products. MWG Biotech expects a production cost reduction of at least 40 percent. Beyond that the Company invests into the development of new applications in the lab automation segment for current projects in this area. Here development costs are incurred for order acquisition. Due to contractual non disclosure agreements and/or the competitive situation more detailed information on the size and scope of the projects currently in progress cannot be given. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 14.05.2004\",\n",

For MM-Karton, this was partly due to seasonality, but can be attributed primarily to the sales opportunities in Non- European markets. MM-Packaging and MM-Graphia benefited from stable consumer behavior despite short-term demand. This led to an increased earnings contribution of the converting sector during the first quarter of 2004, which closed with period results exceeding the previous year's levels. OUTLOOK: The order intake during the first weeks of the second quarter of 2004 currently allows for a satisfactory utilization of capacities in the Divisions. As in the previous quarter, MM-Karton registers high capacity utilization, particularly due to orders from Non-European markets. European demand for consumer goods and consequently for cartonboard packaging, however, still lacks drive and growth. As a result, it is becoming more difficult to stabilize average prices in Western Europe. Otherwise, the European markets for waste paper, reflecting the general demand situation, give no indication of any significant change. Our aim is to maintain high levels of profitability in all Divisions. Continuous cost reductions will therefore remain a prime necessity. Our expansion strategy applies to all three Divisions, with the highest priority on targets in Central and Eastern Europe.

All relevant activities will be concentrated in the new separate entity DEUTZ Power Systems located in Mannheim, Germany. With this step DEUTZ is resolutely continuing the restructuring of its medium and large engines business that began with the DEUTZ Re-Launch Programme. The new business unit DEUTZ Power Systems will concentrate even more intensively on profitable market segments. The key area of focus will be the gas engines business for decentralised power generation. Particularly strong growth rates are expected in the medium term for renewable energy such as landfill-gas and bio-gas. The service business for diesel engines in stationary and marine applications will be further expanded, supported by the existing worldwide service network of DEUTZ AG. The required cost reductions in the medium and large engines business will be achieved through a significant reduction of staff. On a worldwide basis, up to 400 jobs of the approximately 1,550 jobs in the medium and large engines business are to be cut. This reduction of staff is to occur gradually and will depend on the actual engine production programme. The extraordinary costs associated with the restructuring are estimated at Euro 40 million and will be provisioned in the second quarter of 2004. The targets for sales and operating profit for the current financial year remain unchanged. In the medium term DEUTZ anticipates a considerable increase in earnings by approximately Euro 20 million.

This corresponds to an increase of the equity ratio to 57.3 percent (48.3 percent as of March 31, 2003).

MorphoSys brings validated and robust human antibody technologies (HuCAL GOLD(R)) to Novartis' new strategic research directions, building a collaboration that will identify and develop novel therapeutic agents rapidly and efficiently. MorphoSys scientists will work directly with Novartis scientists across the global sites of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), including the new world headquarters in Cambridge, MA, USA. The MorphoSys HuCAL GOLD(R) technology will be an integral part of Novartis' drug discovery and development efforts, with the goal of identifying and developing multiple HuCAL GOLD(R)-derived therapeutic antibodies against many different targets. During the three year term of the agreement, which may be extended up to a total of five years, Novartis will fund internal research at MorphoSys that will generate and optimize HuCAL GOLD(R) antibodies against targets identified by Novartis. In addition, Novartis will have access to the current MorphoSys HuCAL GOLD(R) library at two of its sites. This technology, in conjunction with Novartis' leading research and development capabilities, will potentially enable Novartis to shorten the time needed to generate novel therapeutic as well as research antibodies. Additionally, under the terms of this collaboration Novartis will be MorphoSys' first partner to receive a non-exclusive option on internalization of the entire MorphoSys technology platform, which would trigger an additional payment by Novartis to MorphoSys. Underscoring the strategic nature of the collaboration, Novartis will make an approx. EUR 9 million investment in MorphoSys by purchasing non-interest bearing convertible bonds of MorphoSys. The convertible bonds, with a duration of 6 months, can be converted into 490,133 common MorphoSys shares, to be issued from conditional capital. In addition, MorphoSys will receive over US$ 30 million in committed R&D funding and technology license fees over the first three years. MorphoSys also stands to receive technology license payments, research and developmental milestones, as well as royalties on marketed antibody products. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 19.05.2004\",\n",

       " '- Report on the I. quarter of 2004 - Hard times with good opportunities on the market Oldenburg, May 24, 2004 - Despite declines in sales in the face of a difficult market situation, CeWe Color Holding AG (ISIN DE 000 540 3901, SDAX) - the largest photofinisher in Europe - was able to reinforce its position among competitors and further extend its market shares on the European continent. The photofinishing branch is currently suffering under the influence of consumer caution as a result of a weak economy as well as a slowdown in travelling activities (50 % of all photos taken are those snapped during holiday trips). Unfortunately, this situation did not improve during the first quarter of 2004. First-quarter sales dropped in comparison to the strong first quarter in 2003. The decline amounted to 9.6 %, down to 77.2 mill. Euro, and was primarily due to the fact that January was such a weak month. The drop in sales amounts to 7.7 % if exchange-rate losses in Central Eastern Europe, Norway and Switzerland are not taken into consideration. In the photofinishing sector, the first quarter of the year always generates losses due to low capacity utilization as a result of little travelling activity. Cash flow is therefore at - 0.2 mill. Euro, profit before tax (EBT) total - 9.9 mill. Euro and profit after tax amount to - 9.5 mill. Euro. The negative situation on the market will enhance the position of the company among competitors in the medium term Digital photography necessitates considerable investments in appliances, systems and human resources. Last year CeWe Color invested more than 40 mill. Euro, primarily in digital technology and production plants. This year the corporate group intends to invest another 30 to 35 mill. Euro. Minor competitors are being forced out of the market since they are not in a position to make such investments. One of the most significant competitors in the field of photofinishing has announced that it will be withdrawing from the industrial laboratory sector, at least on a regional basis, within the scope of a change in corporate strategy. In view of this development, CeWe Color now has the chance to expand its market leadership. The group has already managed to expand its third-quarter market share in Germany, Austria and Central Eastern Europe by means of recent successful acquisitions. Improvement in earnings expected in third quarter On the basis of this competitive advantage and also because of stimulation in the travel business, the management of the company expects earnings to improve, particularly in the third quarter of the year. The summer quarter, as a season of travelling with high capacity utilisation, is decisive for the volume of profit generated for the year. Targets set for development in volume, sales and profits for the full year of 2004 remain the same as forecasts published in March: - Development in volume conventional -8 % to -15 % digital +150 % to +200 % total +/- 0 % to - 7 % - Development in sales +/- 0 % to - 7 % - Profits Cash flow 40 to 50 mill.

       " \"BERU increases revenues by more than 16% Ludwigsburg, May 27, 2004 --- In the 2003/04 financial year (ending March 31, 2004), BERU Aktiengesellschaft increased its sales revenues by 16.4% from EUR304.5 million to EUR354.5 million (according to IFRS). EUR17.1 million of the EUR50.0 million total increase in sales revenues were accounted for by the acquisition of the former spark-plug business of Johnson Controls Automotive Electronics, now operating as BERU Eyquem in France. In connection with the changeover to IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), the BERU Italia s.r.l. subsidiary was included in the consolidated group with retroactive effect, so that the comparable basis of revenues for the previous year increased from EUR303.1 million to EUR304.5 million. The Electronics and Sensor Technology division continued its growth path and contributed EUR86.4 million to the Group's sales revenues, after EUR60.1 million in the previous year. The Tire-Pressure Monitoring Systems unit grew by more than 50% from EUR20.5 million to EUR30.8 million. In order to extend our international market leadership in the field of diesel cold-start technology, to strengthen our position in the field of electronics and to introduce the latest technology for spark-plug production at Eyquem, the Group invested EUR35.6 million (EUR30.3 million) in property, plant and equipment. Nonetheless, BERU succeeded in achieving a free cash flow from operating activities equivalent to more than 7% of sales revenues. Cash and marketable securities increased to EUR105.0 million, while the net financial position reached EUR78.2 million. The BERU management is satisfied with the course of business. Chairman of the Executive Board Marco von Maltzan stated that in a generally weak automobile market, BERU has achieved its goal of raising sales revenues by 15% combined with an EBIT margin of at least 15%. More new product launches, our strong product pipeline, and the growing trend towards diesel engines due to the high price of fuel worldwide make our company confident that BERU will take the opportunity to increase sales revenues and operating profit in the current 2004/05 financial year. Assuming moderate growth of the European and Asian vehicle markets, for 2004/05 BERU has set itself the goal of 10% organic growth in sales revenues and an increase in operating profit of at least the same percentage. In all of its entrepreneurial activities and in particular in its research and development, BERU will focus on its core activities of cold-start technology for diesel engines and ignition technology for gasoline engines, in combination with modern electronic control units. In a market featuring continued price pressure, the management will push forward with its PAP (Productivity Action Plan) and will continuously examine the profitability of our product portfolio and of conditions at international locations. Due to numerous new product startups and the growing popularity of diesel vehicles, BERU has full order books. Orders received increased by another 18,0% (significantly higher than the prior year's increase of 7.2%) to EUR374.6 million (EUR317.4 million). The order backlog also grew - by 13.8% - and was at EUR166.2 million as of March 31, 2004 (EUR146.1 million). end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 27.05.2004\",\n",

The development of the operating business was generally in line with expectations. The media company which originated from the merger of the former EM.TV & Merchandising AG with EM.TV Vermögensverwaltungs AG on March 31, 2004, reported consolidated sales of Euro 47.6 million at the end of Q1 (Q1 2003 by EM.TV & Merchandising AG: Euro 67.5 million). Euro 44.1 million thereof were attributable to the Sports segment and Euro 3.4 million to the Entertainment segment (children and youth programs). Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were positive at Euro 2.8 million (Q1 2003: minus Euro 4.4 million). Earnings before taxes (EBT) amounted to Euro 94.5 million (Q1 2003: minus Euro 30.1 million). The high EBT was attributable to an one-off profit of Euro 94.4 million in connection with the restructuring of the convertible bond 2000/2005 which has been completed. As a result, the group reported a net profit for the quarter of Euro 93.5 million after minority interests. After adjusting for this one-off profit, net profit after minority interests would have amounted to minus Euro 0.9 million.

The cash flow for the period under review amounted to Euro 58.8 million (Q1 2003: Euro 21.4 million) and was mainly due to the deconsolidation of the TMG holding (operating cash-flow: minus 4.1 million Euro).

       " 'SNPE and H&R WASAG intend to create leading explosives group The French chemical group, SNPE, and the German special chemicals producer, H&R WASAG, have entered a process aiming at merging their explosives activities. The move will create a leading company in Europe for civil explosives materials with considerable growth potential and high earning power. The merger is the joint answer to the opportunities and challenges presented by a market that has expanded to include 10 new countries and will radically impact the European explosives market. In a letter of intent, SNPE and H&R WASAG have confirmed their intention of merging their activities in the production and distribution of civil explosives products in a Joint Venture. The merger is to be completed in 2004 and is still subject to regulatory approvals, including approval of the relevant anti-trust authorities. The new company will have a sales potential of approx. 150 m Euro p.a., and will enjoy a leading position in particular in France, Germany, Belgium and Hungary. In addition, the company will be sufficiently large to successfully exploit the opportunities in the future markets of Eastern Europe. Here the explosives markets are set to enjoy high growth in the coming years due to the investment needed in the local infrastructure. The group has the technological lead in the area of modern emulsions through the use of its pump technology developed at Westspreng and through high energy packaged emulsions developed by NEF. The group also has a tight distribution network in Eastern Europe through Westspreng. The new company will therefore be well positioned in Europe, both in terms of its geographical presence and with regard to its product range and technical expertise. However the merger will not only be immediately large enough to exploit the opportunities of the expanded European market in an efficient manner, it will also form the basis for further growth through the acquisition of other European suppliers and alliances with explosives companies operating worldwide. This unique historical alliance therefore represents the starting signal for the much needed consolidation of the fragmented European market, which is characterised by many national companies. Due to the historically determined political fragmentation within the continent, most European countries have in the past laid a protective hand over their national explosives companies while in other regions and markets the globalisation desperately needed for economic reasons has indeed taken place. In order to exploit the opportunities of a growing European market larger business entities are required. The joint venture between SNPE and H&R WASAG will not only play a decisive part in shaping this urgently needed consolidation in Europe, it will also enjoy a leading role in influencing and accelerating the imminent generational change in explosives technology. The use of dynamite in the mine and quarry industry (particularly also in the construction business) will be replaced in future by technologically more sophisticated products. In particular, this will include highly developed emulsion technology',\n",
       " 'Product innovations tailored to the market stimulate sales and income Moderate growth planned despite difficult framework conditions Buttenwiesen-Pfaffenhofen, 28 May 2004 - SURTECO AG, the world\\'s leading provider of surface technologies based on specialist technical papers and plastics, successfully bucked the lack of economic activity in the sector during the first quarter (01/01-31/03) of the current fiscal year with an increase in both sales and income. The Group has structured all its activities in the two Strategic Business Units \"Paper\" and \"Plastics\". Sales at 96.8 million euros exceeded sales for the equivalent year-earlier quarter (94.1 million euros) by 3 %. EBITDA at 20.3 million euros was 8 % above the amount for the year-earlier quarter, while EBIT at 13.6 million euros was as much as 11 % up on earnings for that quarter. The company achieved sales amounting to 355 million euros for 2003 and managed to counter the continuing lack of economic activity in the construction and furniture sector with innovative products tailored to the market. The main focus of activities for the SBU Paper is on manufacturing edging strips and flat foils - for example for coating furniture - and it achieved an increase in sales of 5 % to 48.9 million euros by the close of the first three months. Approximately 17.5 million euros were attributable to Germany. The SBU \"Plastics\" produces a range of high-quality products made of different plastics. Thermoplastic edging tapes are the main sales engines and the business unit succeeded in increasing sales during the first quarter to 47.9 million euros (+1 %). 23.7 million euros (+7 %) came from the German market. Since SURTECO AG generates 58 % of consolidated sales abroad, the company was naturally affected by the weak dollar. Assuming adjustments for currency parities, sales in the SBU Paper would have advanced by 6 % to 49.4 million euros and in the SBU Plastics by 3 % to 48.9 million euros. The SBU Paper has invested substantial sums in a new paint facility. This delivers high-quality coating materials based on sophisticated specifications and has proved extremely effective in routine production. The aim now is to expand the range of applications with additional product variants. These include a new foil that is highly resistant to friction, which should open up new market segments (e.g. stairs and windows). The SBU Plastics has also been pursuing innovative production methods which increase the quality of the products while at the same time reducing manufacturing costs. Here, too, they have contributed to optimizing the product range, and this has underscored the technological leadership enjoyed by SURTECO AG in this market. Even if these quarterly figures give grounds for an optimistic outlook, SURTECO AG continues to stand by its cautious estimate for the current business year. Year-end figures slightly above those for 2003 are projected for the end of the year. There is currently no indication of a reversal of the sustained weakness in the furnishing and DIY sectors - particularly in Germany - and any other forecast is therefore precluded. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 28.05.2004',\n",

ISRA again proved its earnings power, with EBITDA rising 41 % to EUR 4.3 million and EBIT soaring 43 % to EUR 2.6 million. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, cash flow from operating activities has risen to EUR 5.1 million (year-before period: EUR 1.6 million). During the same period, fund assets grew EUR 4.1 million to EUR 7.1 million. Growth in the first half was mainly stimulated by glass and plastic operations and by the automobile segment in the United States. The first important milestones have been reached as regards the integration of LASOR AG, which was taken over in the second quarter. The Surface Vision division has been restructured and geared to global market penetration in the fields of the paper and printing industry, too. The market response to new products presented at the international DRUPA trade fair was gratifying. All in all, Surface Vision will continue to be the division with the highest contribution to sales also in subsequent quarters. The competitive position of the Surface Vision Division and the order backlog of over EUR 15 million confirm our recently adjusted forecasts for the fiscal year: Total output over 40 % growth and EBT 25 % growth. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 28.05.2004',\n",
       " \"plenum AG optimistic following Q1 revenue development - Revenues climb to EUR 10.7 million - Order backlog increased to EUR 20.3 million - Earnings impacted by higher risk provisions Wiesbaden, May 28, 2004 plenum AG generated revenues of around EUR 10.7 million in the first three months of financial year 2004 - a rise of 13% as against the previous quarter (EUR 9.5 million) and also a slight increase as against the previous year (EUR 10.6 million). Given the continued muted demand, this positive development and the order backlog rise from EUR 10.6 million (December 31, 2003) to EUR 20.3 million (March 31, 2004) should be seen as positive signals for future business developments in 2004. The cautious assessment of the probability of risks occurring is a key principle of corporate management at plenum AG in the interests of a medium- and long- term increase in the Company's value. In view of this, the Company had to increase risk provisions by EUR 0.5 million in Q1, particularly for existing large projects. No further impact on earnings is expected in the following quarters from these risks. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) thus amounted to EUR -0.1 million after three months, as against EUR 0.4 million in the same period of the previous year. After three months, plenum's net loss for the period totaled approximately EUR -0.3 million (previous year: net income for the period of EUR 0.1 million). Earnings per share amounted to EUR -0.03 after three months (previous year: EUR 0.01) for 9,577,068 no-par value shares in each case. No reliable outlook for financial year 2004 can be given at present since the economy remains subdued and, as a result, customers are reluctant to invest. However, the Managing Board currently has no reason to believe that the Company will not match the previous year's revenues and earnings given the high level of booked business and its systematic risk management.

Subject to approval of the capital measures by the annual shareholders' meeting, to successful implementation of the capital increase and to approval of it by the German regulatory authority BAFin, the agreements reached between the company, banks and investors will overcome aap's financial crisis and provide the company with fresh liquidity. The concept is based for one on a guarantee by the investors to fund a capital increase in cash for the company of at least EUR 8 million and a maximum of EUR 10 million at a share price of EUR 1.00. Shareholders' stock options rights will be upheld in connection with the capital increase. Further details will be announced shortly. In addition, the investors will shortly provide an EUR 800,000 bridging loan to keep the company solvent until the capital increase. In return, aap undertakes to pay off its existing bank loans of nearly EUR 11 million from the banks at a reduced rate of approx. EUR 5 million once the capital increase in cash has been successfully implemented. Along with the financial consolidation the company will be making personnel changes. Oliver Bielenstein, previously a partner in Ernst & Young AG, Switzerland, has joined the Board as the new CFO. Uwe Ahrens, the company's founder and CEO, will retain his role. Bruke Seyoum Alemu, the previous CFO, will in future be in charge of sales and marketing on the Management Board. Changes in membership of the Supervisory Board are envisaged and are likely to be announced with the invitation to attend the annual shareholders' meeting. As a part of the negotiations with investors, the Management Board has drawn up a consolidation concept that provides for a number of strategic adjustments as a precondition for the recapitalization commitment. These strategic adjustments led to additional value adjustment requirements in the company's balance sheet, but none with an effect on liquidity. These value adjustments apply mainly to intangible assets, with the result that the provisional consolidated net loss for fiscal 2003 as announced in April will increase to EUR 15.4 million. Consolidated equity capital as at Dec. 31, 2003 totaled EUR 6.3 million and the equity ratio was around 23%. Once the capital increase has been implemented, the company's equity before consolidation profits will increase to more than EUR 14 million.

Sales and marketing expenses and R&D expenses remained at the same level as in the corresponding period in 2003, 1.7 million Euros and 0.3 million Euros, respectively. - Income before income taxes for the reported period was 0.08 million Euros compared to 0.5 million Euros in the same period of fiscal year 2003. - The net loss for the reported period was 0.07 million Euros compared to a net profit of 0.1 million Euros for the same period last year and compared to a net loss of 3.7 million Euros in all 2003, resulting in a loss per share of 0.01 Euro compared to earning per share of 0.01 Euros for the first three months of fiscal year 2003. - Shareholder's equity as of March 31, 2004 was 40.4 million Euros compared to EUR40.5 as of December 31, 2003, with a ratio to the total balance sheet of 62,7 percent in the reported period compared to 60.8 percent on March 31, 2003. Since part of Electronics 3000 Ltd.'s revenues are generated in USD, the about 18 percent higher average USD-Euro exchange rate in the first quarter of 2004 compared to the same period last year, affected the revenues by causing a decline in revenues when presenting the USD revenues in Euro. The Company's financial statements are measured in Euro, whereas taxes are calculated in Israel, based on the value of the Shekel. The change in the exchange rate between the Euro and the New Israeli Shekel may result in a profit for financial reporting purposes, which differs materially from that reported for tax purposes. A high appreciation in the Euro against the New Israeli Shekel during the reporting period accentuates this phenomenon. The result is disproportionately high tax expenses in relation to income before taxes. On Electronics Line (E.L.) Ltd.: Electronics Line (E.L.)

The Company anticipates that this step will in the course of the current business year lead to AG sales almost doubling (AG sales 2003: EUR 2.9 million), and as of 2005 the JWP AG business volume will increase by at least a factor of three. This growth and the prime performance in Q1 have prompted the Board of Management to raise the 2004 forecast for Group profits. From today's viewpoint, full-year 2004 will now close with a high double-digit percentage increase (Group net income for 2003: EUR 1.54 million). The new distribution model has been agreed for a period of five years and is based on a distribution contract: Under its terms, the complete dealer sales price (DSP) will be booked by Jack White Productions AG as sales, whereas under the prior Label license agreement only a share of less than 30 % of the DSP was booked. BMG will in future receive a lump-sum payment for distributing the audio recordings and, unlike in the previous model, no longer bears the risk of returns, which as a rule was less than 15 % in recent years. Moreover, alongside the promotion work as of July JWP AG will also handle the marketing activities (e.g., TV commercials) and will therefore be able to control these more closely. In this context, the team has been strengthened, with Helmut Schnittke, previously a assistant to the BMG Sales Director, now employed by JWP as Sales Manager. In addition, Rainer Tarara, most recently Head of Distribution for the Universal Music Group, will in future act as consultant supporting the Jack White Productions AG staff.

Alphaform AG (ticker symbol: ATF) won the biggest single contract in its history from Philipp Morris on 3 June 2004. The EUR 2.5 million order covers the production of a small batch and will be completed in the current business year. The new contract crowns Alphaform's efforts to find another client in the non-automotive sector. In 2003, the automotive sector accounted for 76% of Alphaform's EUR 22.4 million turnover. The Philip Morris order is hence equivalent to nearly half of 2003's non-automotive revenue. Being able to transfer its expertise from activities for the automotive industry to non-automotive activities and garnering follow-up orders from prototyping clients for small batches underline Alphaform's business model, under which the Alphaform Group is a system supplier with growth potential from the field of prototyping to small batches.

Zapf Creation AG is expecting sales of around EUR 190 million for fiscal year 2004. Adjusted for currency translation effects, sales should amount to around EUR 194 million (2003: EUR 201.4 million). A cost reduction plan that was introduced early on will help ensure that the operating expenses in 2004 are lower than in the previous year.

Sales development in 2004 is being affected primarily by the decline in the international mini doll business.

Punitive damages are additional payments based on the reprehensible nature of the offence. They are in addition to the actual damages and are intended to have a punitive effect and act as a deterrent.

The management has approved considerable cost-reduction measures. According to transtec, the cause for the downward revision is the failure of the upturn in hardware demand anticipated at the beginning of the year to materialise, as well as the downward pressure on prices that have resulted from the shakeout taking place in the hardware market. Moreover, while a weaker dollar reduces the price of system components, these lower costs must on the other hand be passed on directly via the price, leading to reduced profits. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 22.06.2004\",\n",

       " \"AGM approves share conversion resolution By a large majority, the AGM of KRONES AG, Neutraubling, Germany, has approved a conversion of the non-voting KRONES preference shares into KRONES ordinary shares. Around 99,9 percent of the shareholders at the AGM in Neutraubling voted in favour of the share conversion, at a ratio of 1 to 1. Following a partial conversion six years ago, all preference shares (whose owners enjoyed the advantage of a higher dividend, but possessed no voting rights in the AGM), will now be converted into ordinary shares with voting rights. KRONES AG has issued a total of 10,531,024 individual share certificates. Hitherto, ordinary shares accounted for 66 percent of these (6,955,729 shares) and preference shares for 34 percent (3,575,295 shares). Now that the two share categories have been merged, 46 percent of the ordinary shares (4,838,479) are in widely diversified ownership. The voting rights held by the Kronseder family correspond to a capital share of 54 percent (5,692,545 shares). Conversion of the preference shares into ordinary shares opens up favourable scenarios for KRONES on the financial market. The world's market leader for beverage bottling/canning lines and packaging machinery has first of all lastingly strengthened its weighting on the German M-DAX stock index; the larger number of freely tradable securities created by this conversion increases the group's market capitalisation, and thus its liquidity, with concomitantly heightened attention from the market and the analysts.

Dividend payout of 0.80 euro - The Annual General Meeting of Europe's most important photofinishing company with a definite majority of votes approved the proposal of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to pay out a dividend of 0.80 euro per share on the share capital entitled to dividend amounting to 14.1 million euro. Taking into consideration the current market value, the dividend yield is more than 4.3 %. Demanding times with big chances - During the first quarter 2004 the photofinishing as well as the slack tourism sector continued to suffer from a restraint consumption triggered by the current market situation. In addition, the digital photography is demanding all market participants to adapt their business models, resources and investments to the changed conditions. The digital photography requires substantial investments in appliances, systems and staff. Less important competitors disappear from the market as they are not able to make all these investments. One of the most important competitors in the field of photofinishing as a result of their strategic reorientation, has announced an initial regional withdrawal from this sector. CeWe Color has the chance to further enhance their position as market leader in the photofinishing sector with a market share of 33 % during the coming months. 2004 targets and key data - The first quarter can only provide at a limited rate information about sales figures, turnover and revenue of the reporting year. The third quarter is decisive for CeWe Color with regard to the summer travel season. The Board of Management thus confirms the earlier announced forecast for 2004: - Development in volume conventional -8% to -15% digital +150% to +200% total +/-0% to -7% - Sales +/-0% to -7% 2003 - Profits cash flow 40 to 50 million euro 46.5 million euro EBT 10 to 18 million euro 13.2 million euro - Investments 30 to 35 million euro 40.6 million euro - Dividend for the buisiness year 2004 0.70 to 0.90 euro 0.80 euro A reevaluation can most probably only take place after the second quarter. The economic situation for CeWe Color will noticeably improve from the third quarter 2004 onward\",\n",

The two core business areas have been transferred to new companies. Thus Mosaic has commenced the sustained implementation of the restructuring process announced at the beginning of the 2004 financial year. The restructuring of the subsidiary acquired in 2000 is Mosaic Group's reaction to the ongoing difficult environment in the finance sector, which is evidencing a sustained and far-reaching concentration and consolidation process. The objective of the measures taken is to ensure the continuation of all customer services and products at the same high standard. In the context of a spin off, the core business unit X/EASY and TKD (the technical customer service) along with PC production and distribution has been taken over by former Mosaic Geva GmbH employees with all rights and obligations and forms now the core operating area of the newly founded Geva Business Solutions GmbH located in Alsdorf. All existing contracts will continue to be honoured in full. The new company has taken on the development, support and consultancy teams from the former business unit, thereby safeguarding continuity of existing business relations and the ongoing development of the portfolio. The second core business unit is GPayS. There the former Mosaic Geva GmbH generated approximately 47 percent of its 2003 revenues (TEUR 9,105). This will now be continued by Payment Factory GmbH & Co. KG. The general partner is Payment Factory Verwaltung GmbH. The two companies are full subsidiaries of Mosaic Software AG and will be headquartered in Meckenheim near Bonn. The focus of the Payment Factory GmbH & Co. KG product range is GPayS, the first standard solution available in the transaction banking market for processing paperless domestic mass payments.

But both telephony markets will remain coexistent for all the foreseeable future. All today\\'s telephone sets will be able to use, without any change, this coexistence of telecommunications services provided by POTS/ISDN resp. Internet for achieving further significant cost reductions of telephony. This applies also for modems, codecs and many other telecommunications terminal devices and network service access providing systems in use today. In order to enable all network users to leverage, at any time and at utmost simplicity, this coexistence of \"line switching\" and \"packet switching\" telecommunications services (of the POTS/ISDN resp. Internet via xDSL or classical access), certain telecommunications techniques are indispensable. For its \"IntraStar technique\" - which is a particularly powerful such technique - TELES was granted already a German Patent (DE 196 45 368 C2) and a European Patent (EP 0 929 884 B1), while the US patent application is still pending. After careful consideration, the TELES management board just decided to file a suit with the Landgericht Mannheim, for the time being only against the probably worldwide leading company in this area of integrated POTS/ISDN/xDSL/Internet telephony, the US American Quintum Technologies, Inc., and its certified German sales partner, the IP Telekom GmbH, because of violating the European Patent in Germany by means of its \"Tenor-Switch\" (see the \"Patent Violation Forum\" on http://www.teles.de from next Monday). TELES is still reconfirming its current opinion that a variety of comparable \"voice over IP\" systems/devices - being less powerful than the above Tenor- Switch - already on or announced for the market by quite recognized companies, would also violate these patents just as those network services delivering companies employing such VoIP systems/devices.

       " \"QIAGEN Completes Management Buyout of its Synthetic DNA Business Unit QIAGEN to Keep its siRNA Business and to Retain Preferred Access to Synthetic DNA Supply Venlo, The Netherlands, June 30, 2004 - QIAGEN N.V. (Nasdaq: QGENF; Frankfurt, Prime Standard: QIA) today announced that it has sold its synthetic DNA business to a management team previously employed at QIAGEN and which operated parts of this business. The new company is backed by private investors and QIAGEN will retain a minority stake of 16%. The new company, to be named Operon Biotechnologies Inc., expects to continue to expand the leadership position QIAGEN has built in this market. QIAGEN will retain all rights and activities in its leading siRNA business including ownership of QIAGEN's proprietary TOM- amidite chemistry. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, QIAGEN will retain a minority equity ownership of 16% in Operon Biotechnologies and, in addition, receive a consideration of approximately US$ 24.3 million, of which approximately US$ 17.8 million are in cash and the remainder in a promissory note. In addition, QIAGEN will receive preferred access to Operon Biotechnologies' synthetic nucleic acid manufacturing capacities as well as preferred purchasing rights. QIAGEN also has the exclusive right to utilize these highly efficient manufacturing capacities and the value of their continued improvements for contract manufacturing of siRNA products that QIAGEN will continue to market. QIAGEN's synthetic DNA business primarily consists of business built organically and business added through the acquisitions of Operon Technologies Inc. in Alameda, California in 2000 and the Sawady Group in Tokyo in April 2001. The resulting business unit, with operations in the US, Germany and Japan focused on providing custom oligonucleotides, and, increasingly, shelf products such as array ready oligo sets (AROS). QIAGEN had issued a total of approximately 3.7 million common shares to acquire these businesses. While QIAGEN is selling majority ownership in these business activities, QIAGEN believes that significant value is retained at QIAGEN through the preferred access and preferred terms. Based on forecasts for this business, it was expected to contribute approximately 10% of QIAGEN consolidated net sales and approximately 7% of its operating profit in the second half of fiscal 2004. The transaction is effective from June 30, 2004 at which time QIAGEN accounts for these business activities as a minority, passive investment and as a result, ceases to reflect their revenues and operating income as of such date. The management team leading the buyout is headed by Patrick A. Weiss. Patrick A. Weiss was the founder of Xeragon Inc, which QIAGEN acquired in 2002 and is an expert in nucleic acid chemistry and chemical synthesis operations. QIAGEN believes this transaction will strongly benefit the company as QIAGEN retains key preferred access rights to the technology and product platform as well as preferred purchasing rights while at the same being able to strongly focus on its very attractive core business. QIAGEN will host a conference call on July 1, 2004 at 3:30pm CET. A webcast of the conference call will be available at www.videonewswire.com/QIAGEN/070104\",\n",

       " 'PULSION and Carl Zeiss Conclude Exclusive License Agreement Worldwide A new technology for the intraoperative visualization of blood vessels is being integrated into surgical microscopes from Carl Zeiss. This technology known as IC-VIEW will considerably expand the application base of the diagnostic drug ICG-PULSION. Munich, July 1, 2004. The companies PULSION Medical Systems AG, Munich, and Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, have signed a license agreement for the integration of IC- VIEW technology into neurosurgical microscopes from Carl Zeiss. The agreement has been concluded on an exclusive global basis for a duration of five years. Pulsion AG, a life science enterprise specializing in medical diagnostic and therapy systems, is listed on the Prime Standard of the Frankfurt stock exchange in Germany. Carl Zeiss, the leading German company in the optical and opto- electronic industry, is a world market leader in the field of surgical visualization systems. IC-VIEW technology is based on the fluorescent properties of the diagnostic drug ICG-PULSION when irradiated with infrared light (IR) of a defined wavelength. After the intravenous injection of ICG-PULSION, irradiation with IR light makes even the smallest blood vessels or blood vessel malformations clearly visible. In addition, blood perfusion can be quantified and recorded. In this way, IC- VIEW technology allows the neurosurgeon to use a totally new method to visually check the success of the procedure during surgery. PULSION owns a large, global family of industrial property rights that protects this technology. The exclusive license agreement with Carl Zeiss covers not only neurosurgery, but also the introduction of IC-VIEW technology in other surgical disciplines. For the recently introduced OPMI Pentero surgical microscope, Carl Zeiss will present an additional option for IC-VIEW technology later this year and initially launch it on the European market. Carl Zeiss is paying license fees to PULSION, and will recommend the use of ICG-PULSION with the surgical microscopes. For PULSION, this move means a considerable expansion of the market for the ICG-PULSION drug already being successfully used in ophthalmology and liver function diagnostics. PULSION has been granted drug approval for ICG- PULSION not only in Germany, but also in the United Kingdom and expects to obtain approval in 10 further important EU countries this year. Motivated by the license agreement with Carl Zeiss, PULSION will now make FDA approval in the USA its top priority. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 01.07.2004',\n",

Group revenues of EUR354.5 million according to IFRS were EUR50 million higher than in the prior year (EUR304.5 million). Net income amounted to EUR35.9 million after EUR30.6 in 2002/03. Impairment tests carried out in accordance with IFRS on the value of the individual segments of the BERU Group resulted in an impairment charge of EUR1.5 million being recognized for the General Industry segment, with a consequential impact on EBIT and all subsequent measures of pre-tax earnings. EBIT rose by more than 30% from EUR41.0 million to EUR53.4 million, with an EBIT margin of 15.1%. Operating profit amounted to EUR53.4 million (prior year: EUR42.6 million including a disposal gain of EUR1.6 million). Before the write- down due to the impairment tests, EBIT amounted to EUR54.9 million, equivalent to an EBIT margin of 15.5%. Despite lower interest and investment income of EUR3.1 million (prior year: EUR3.4 million), the Group's pre-tax earnings increased to EUR56.5 million (prior year: EUR46.0 million). Earnings per share climbed to EUR3.59, or EUR3.69 before the impairment charge (prior year: EUR3.07). The operative free cash flow reached EUR24.7 million. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held on September 14, 2004 that a dividend of EUR1.10 be distributed, as in the prior year. The rise in revenues of more than 16% was due in particular to the solid growth of the Diesel Cold-Start Technology division, the increasing number of new technologies introduced and new product launches, and high growth rates by the newest division of Electronics and Sensor Technology, which generated sales revenues of EUR86.4 million in the year under review after EUR60.1 million in the prior year. The Tire-Pressure Monitoring Systems unit grew by more than 50% from EUR20.5 million to EUR30.8 million. In the core division of Diesel Cold-Start Technology, BERU recently received an order from DaimlerChrysler to supply ISS (Instant Start System) technology for the new Mercedes-Benz 4-cylinder diesel engine. Furthermore, BERU took another quantum leap in diesel cold-start technology with the development of PSG, the intelligent pressure-sensor glow plug. R&D expenditure in 2003/04 was EUR27.6 million, EUR2.4 million more than in the prior year and once again above the industry average. Assuming moderate growth of the European and Asian automobile markets, the Group believes it is well positioned to increase its sales revenues through organic growth by at least 10% in the current financial year.

Both key figures improved quarter-on-quarter by EUR 0.7 million and EUR 0.8 million, respectively, and year-on-year by EUR 0.1 million and EUR 0.3 million, respectively.

DNABarrier II is one of three applications currently under development, using the dSLIM immunomodulator technology, developed and patented by MOLOGEN. Following signature of a detailed term sheet, a first installment of 0.4 Mill. Euro was received by MOLOGEN. This licensing deal is for MOLOGEN the first financially important outcome from strategic alliances with biopharmaceutical companies and investors in China. The license embraces the use of DNABarrier II in treatments of several major cancers, among others colorectal carcinoma (bowel-cancer). It covers the pharmaceutical markets of China and other East Asian countries, including South Korea and Japan. MOLOGEN retains the exclusive rights for Europe, USA and the rest of the world. Under the licensing deal MOLOGEN will receive a total of 1 Mill Euro in upfront payment in two more installments. Furthermore, milestone payments, differentiated by countries, were agreed on, during progress of clinical co-development and regulatory approval. For royalty payments to MOLOGEN on product revenues, rates are also differentiated by countries, and are highest for Japan. MOLOGEN will medium term invest 0.8 Mill Euro into the clinical development program, performed in China according to international standards. Therefore, Starvax will provide MOLOGEN with all data and knowledge derived from the clinical development program. MOLOGEN intends to build additional deals with European and US companies, based on the results of this German-Chinese partnership. Prof Burghardt Wittig, CEO of MOLOGEN, said: \"This is one of the first international biotech-biotech deals involving a Chinese company. Still the Chinese pharmaceutical market in financial terms is a small fraction of the world market. By the time the potential products against cancer will be ready for marketing in China, market size is estimated to have tripled. For MOLOGEN this deal is significant in terms of future access to these rapidly growing Chinese and Asian markets. At the same time we will gain clinical data that will multiply for MOLOGEN the value and probability of a licensing deal with western pharmaceutical companies involving DNABarrier II. General information about Starvax Starvax (http://www.starvax.com) is a biotech start-up company in Beijing, founded by several scientists and managers who returned from the USA to P.R. China. They have many years of experience in research and development with the world\\'s leading biotech companies. Starvax has a very strong financial backup from its lead investor Bright Oceans Corporation (BOCO), a leading high-tech company in China. General information about MOLOGEN MOLOGEN uses its unique and patented DNA technologies MIDGE(R) and dSLIM(R) as a platform for research and development on DNA-vaccines and DNA-therapeutics. They will be applied to prevent and cure a wide range of high-unmet-need diseases. Going public in 1998, MOLOGEN was one of the first German biotechnology companies to be floated on the stock exchange. The MOLOGEN shares are traded on the Geregelter Markt in Frankfurt',\n",
       " 'EADS specifies impact of Airbus GIE merger into Airbus SAS As a result of an accounting driven adjustment, EBIT* forecast for 2004 is increased by Euro 130 million to Euro 1.93 billion Tax authorities agreement of April 2004 has enabled a simplification of the Airbus legal structure Half-year 2004 results will be released as planned on 29 July EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space company, EAD) has now specified the impact of the Airbus GIE merger into Airbus SAS, which was completed following an agreement among European tax authorities. This triggers accounting consequences and leads to a positive net impact on the company\\'s EBIT* of around Euro 130 million in 2004. As a result of this accounting adjustment, the EBIT* 2004 forecast of EADS has increased from Euro 1.8 billion to Euro 1.93 billion with no associated cash impact. On the occasion of the release of its first- quarter financial results on May 12, 2004, the company had announced that such an impact was to be expected. In 2002 a specific project was initiated at Airbus to merge Airbus GIE and Airbus SAS. This triggered complex consultations with fiscal authorities which had been successfully concluded with the official approval of the new setup by European tax authorities in April 2004. As a consequence, the Airbus GIE, a US- Dollar denominated entity, was merged in April 2004 within Airbus SAS, a Euro- denominated company, effective January 1st 2004. Airbus GIE was historically a US-Dollar entity, with books kept in US-Dollar that were translated into Euro at each closing with the translation difference recorded in equity (Currency Translation Adjustments, CTA). Due to the deterioration of the US-Dollar over the past periods, the Airbus GIE related CTA is a positive equity amount. Following the new setup, a different accounting treatment is applied to balance sheet items of the former Airbus GIE. From January 1, 2004, since all transactions occur in a Euro accounting environment, no additional CTA is generated. Specifically, customer Pre-Delivery-Payments (PDP) received after that date are translated into Euro at the prevailing exchange rate of the date they are received and recognised into revenues upon aircraft delivery at that historical rate. In line with this accounting treatment and in compliance with International Accounting Standards (IAS 21), outstanding CTA which relates to aircraft to be delivered after January 1, 2004 will be released to the Profit & Loss Statement (P&L), while the remaining portion of the outstanding CTA will remain frozen in Equity. Compared to the 2004 targets disclosed in March 2004, the CTA-release generates additional revenues which are partly offset by additional costs of sales. The net impact is an EBIT* increase of around Euro 130 million in 2004. There is no cash effect. Under this treatment, EBIT* reflects more closely the profitability of individual deliveries throughout their contractual life, as it incorporates portions of revenues from PDP and costs at historical rates. * EADS uses EBIT pre-goodwill amortization and exceptionals as a key indicator of its economic performance. The term \"exceptionals\" refers to income or expenses of a non-recurring nature, such as amortization expenses of fair value adjustments relating to the EADS merger, impairment losses, and dilution gains from the formation of Airbus S.A.S. and MBDA. It does not correspond to the definition of extraordinary items under IFRS',\n",
       " 'CeWe Color is concentrating its production capacities in Paris Oldenburg, July 13, 2004 - CeWe Color - the largest photofinisher in Europe - is merging its production capacities in Paris. As of October 30, 2004, the production plant of Konica Photo Service France (KPSF) will be closed down and production will be transferred to the CeWe Color plant 10 kilometres away. Merging production will generate substantial synergy effects and cut costs considerably. For the CeWe Color Group, the market in France is the second-largest one after Germany. Every year 60 million inhabitants use approximately 110 million film rolls. With eight production plants, CeWe Color currently holds a market share in industrial photofinishing of 30 %. The corporate group generated turnover of 71.3 million euros in the 2003 accounting period with a staff of 630 members. On February 1 2001, CeWe Color took over Konica Photo Service France (KPSF) and was hence able to increase its market share of 15 % to 20 %. At that time, CeWe Color was number four on the photofinishing market behind Fuji, Kodak and Spector. The strategically-vital takeover of Konica Photo Service France meant that the sales volume in France was raised by 40 % within a period of three years. At the same time this move enabled Konica Photo Service France listings with important major French retail chains to be assumed by the entire French CeWe Color Group. Dr. Rolf Hollander, Chairman of the Board of Management with CeWe Color Holding AG, points out that merging the two production locations in Paris would generate many synergy effects in the areas of production, logistics, EDP, etc. for the CeWe Color Group and that this would have a positive effect on costs and income. Besides, France is a country with a healthy economy and economic growth is likely to exceed 3 % there this year. The Board of Management of CeWe Color feels that the French market still has potential. Digital photography is one of the most important growth generators on the market, and last month just over 11 % of sales in France were achieved with digital products and services',\n",

Almost all product segments contributed to the increase in sales volume - servers (+33%), flat screens (+23%), notebooks (+16%) and desktop systems (+9%) were particularly successful. In spite of the sales volume growth, EBIT fell off by 2.3 million Euro to minus 5.8 million Euro because sales margins were under pressure, particularly with flat screens and notebooks, and other expenditure was higher than in the same quarter of the previous year. MAXDATA considers the original planning for the business year 2004 with EBIT in the range of 4 to 7 million Euro and a turnover of 680 to 710 million Euro to be within reach.

       " \"Wolford proves itself in a difficult environment in fiscal 2003/2004 Bregenz and Vienna, Austria, July 16, 2004 The listed company Wolford AG succeeded in posting a positive result for the 2003/2004 fiscal year ended April 30. In an extremely difficult period for luxury item providers, all earnings figures remained positive despite sales declining by 7.4 percent to EUR 119.2 million. This is proof that the restructuring program initiated three years ago is having a sustained impact, thus providing an excellent basis for the targeted stimulation of business. The improvement in the trend was particularly apparent in the fourth quarter: Adjusted for currency effects, sales remained at the same level year on year. Around half of the decline in sales is due to exchange rate fluctuations. The loss of business from closing unprofitable own boutiques was responsible for 28.1 percent of the lost revenue. The number of outlets was reduced from 248 the previous year to 226. Retail business reported growth in all markets; on a constant-currency, same-store basis, sales were up 12 percent. EBIT receded from EUR 3.4 million to EUR 2.6 million. Although the EBIT margin of 2.2 percent testifies to the success of the restructuring measures in an exceedingly difficult environment, the Company still is not satisfied and will seek to improve margins primarily by expanding sales. Earnings before taxes (EBT) were EUR 1.0 million compared to EUR 1.4 million the previous year. Net profit for the year fell from EUR 2.5 million to EUR 0.9 million due mainly to the lower deferred tax assets. This puts earnings per share at 18 cents. Shareholders' equity rose from EUR 64.4 million to EUR 65.1 million, which improved the equity ratio to 47.9 percent. Wolford further optimized its financing structure and at the end of the last fiscal year net debt had been reduced to EUR 23.4 million, cutting it in half since 2001/2002. As a consequence, the gearing ratio showed a very positive development last year, dropping to 36.0 percent. The sales momentum seen in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year was carried over in a positive way into the first weeks of the new fiscal year. With the financial and organizational restructuring of the company now largely complete, the management is concentrating entirely on expanding sales while protecting and widening margins. Sales growth even in the single digits should generate disproportionately higher earnings growth, thus bringing Wolford much closer to the medium-term goal of delivering a double-digit EBIT margin\",\n",
       " 'EUWAX AG raises profit forecast to 3,08 EUR per share for the current year - Introduction of a cap of transaction costs to target medium-term an increase of transaction volume In the second quarter of 2004 the business development of EUWAX AG continued to perform well. However, the growth of profits decreased in the light of stagnating capital markets and declining transaction volumes. Nevertheless the company reached the second highest turnover and the third best net income historically. The higher than expected mid-year net income of EUR 10.0 millions and (61 % year-on-year), prompts EUWAX AG to lift the profit forecast for the full year 2004 to EUR 15.7 millions (+32 %) or EUR 3.08 per share. The estimations for the second half of 2004 are again based on conservative scenarios: - Restrained turnover at the German stock exchanges until the end of the year. - Earnings decline in commission fees, caused by the introduction of a cap for transaction costs in the trading of derivative products and stocks at EUR 12 per trade, beginning at the fourth quarter of 2004. This cap is not expected to generate related growth in turnover in 2004. - Higher administrative expenditures linked to new strategic projects (mainly for advisory and other services, IT and international business).

       " \"Infineon Reports Third Quarter Results for Fiscal Year 2004 Infineon Technologies AG, one of the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers, today announced results for the third quarter of its 2004 fiscal year, ended June 30, 2004. The company had revenues of Euro 1,908 million, an increase of 14 percent sequentially and 30 percent year-on-year. The sequential growth was achieved mainly through higher prices for products of the Memory Products segment, as well as higher demand for products of the Secure Mobile Solutions segment. The company has increased by Euro 184 million to Euro 212 million its accrued charge in connection with the ongoing US and European DRAM antitrust investigations and related potential civil claims, as described below. This accrual resulted in a net loss in the third quarter of Euro 56 million, compared to net income of Euro 39 million in the previous quarter, and to a net loss of Euro 116 million a year ago. Quarterly EBIT of Euro 2 million declined from Euro 71 million in the previous quarter, and an EBIT loss of Euro 116 million in the third quarter of the last fiscal year. Excluding the effect of the additional accrual, the company would have had positive EBIT of Euro 186 million for the quarter. The sequential and year-on-year quarterly earnings increases, excluding the effect of the additional accrual, were due primarily to higher chip prices in the Memory Products segment, and both higher volumes and increased productivity in the Secure Mobile Solutions segment. Basic and diluted earnings per share decreased to a loss of Euro 0.08 in the third quarter, compared to earnings of Euro 0.05 in the previous quarter. If the effect of the accrual were excluded, basic and diluted earnings per share would have been Euro 0.14, a significant year-on-year improvement from a loss per share of Euro 0.16. Free cash flow, significantly improved to Euro 146 million, increasing from Euro 53 million in the previous quarter. The improved sequential free cash flow reflects higher cash flows generated from operations of Euro 506 million compared to Euro 463 million in the previous quarter. Infineon's gross cash position amounted to Euro 2.8 billion, decreasing sequentially from Euro 2.9 billion. During the third quarter, Infineon redeemed Euro 200 million of its convertibles notes due 2007, which will reduce future interest expenses. DRAM antitrust investigations As previously reported, since June 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating possible violations of U.S. Federal antitrust laws in the DRAM industry. Infineon's US subsidiary has been responding to the inquiries. Subsequent to the commencement of the investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, a total of 25 purported class action lawsuits were filed against Infineon and other DRAM suppliers in various federal and state courts in the United States. The complaints allege violations of federal and state antitrust and competition laws and seek significant damages on behalf of the plaintiffs. Infineon has also been approached by certain of its major customers seeking compensation for damages arising out of Infineon's alleged anticompetitive behavior. Infineon Technologies AG is also in the process of responding to a request for information made by the European Commission in April 2003 with respect to practices in the European market for DRAM memory products. In accordance with US GAAP, Infineon records liabilities, including accruals for significant litigation costs, related to legal claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the associated amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 Infineon has increased to Euro 212 million from the previous accrual of Euro 28 million that it made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 in connection with the ongoing antitrust investigations, civil claims and related expenses. Given the uncertainties inherent in predicting the outcome of these continuing investigations and the related litigation and claims, and in predicting future costs, Infineon is, at this time, unable to predict the full financial and other impact that these investigations, lawsuits and claims may have on the company. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 20.07.2004\",\n",

KG with ret-roactive effect as of January 1, 2004. paragon's board sees this as an important step for the future of paragon AG. Haller has been a leader in electromechanics for many years, in par-ticular in the development and production of customized indicators for the automotive indus-try. This acquisition sensibly expands the profile of paragon's operating controls product area with a view to the future. Neither party will disclose the purchase price. For paragon, this acquisition represents a milestone. After the successful integration of the air quality sensor segment acquired from Bosch, paragon is continuing the adopted strategy and is seeking external growth in addition to strong internal growth. Haller's business gives paragon an opportunity to expand the operating controls product area in order to more com-prehensively cover the man-machine interface in automobiles. In the past, paragon supplied automotive manufacturers with modules for electronic transmission control units and multifunction steering wheels as well as communication components. According to the board, the portfolio is now being expanded. paragon is adding indicators like tachometers, car clocks, and temperature and pressure gauges. The technological basis paragon has acquired consists of state-of-the-art, patented stepper motors that can be used for a variety of applications. Haller GmbH, founded in 1925, equips the latest Porsche 911 with a sports chronograph and also supplies customers including Smart, Bentley, Bugatti, and MAN. According to paragon's board, it is a profitable company: Sales are expected to reach Euro 7.0 million in fiscal 2004 and top Euro 10.0 million in 2005. According to management of both companies, the production facility in St. Georgen in Baden-Württemberg will be maintained. The products and expertise of Haller gives paragon an opportunity to expand its background in electromechanics, so that in addition to the established sensor products the company will also be able to deliver actuators to its customers in the future. paragon is steadily becoming a more comprehensive module and system manufacturer in operating controls for automo-biles. According to the board, this is just the first step in the Group's planned expansion which is to be financed using profit-sharing-rights capital. At its Annual General Meeting in May 2004, paragon was authorized by way of an advance resolution to issue profit-sharing rights up to an amount of Euro 30 million for the purpose of strategic acquisitions. In early June, paragon signed an agreement with IKB Private Equity GmbH and DKB Deutsche Kreditbank AG concerning the realization of the first tranche in the amount of Euro 8 million\",\n",

The selling and administrative expenses decreased by 10,3 percent in the first quarter due to cost cutting measures which were initiated in the last fiscal year. In total they declined from KEUR 4.607 to KEUR 4.134. The operating profit totals KEUR 159 (prior year: KEUR 259), a reduction of 36,8 percent.

       " 'ARBOmedia AG: Results of the Second Quarter 2004 In the 2nd quarter of 2004, the ARBOmedia AG reached a turnover of EUR 21.3 million and thereby exceeds expectations by around EUR 1.3 million. The half year turnover thus is at EUR 36.0 million (previous year period EUR 40.8 million). The decrease is due to the termination of the contracts with STV and TVG last year end. The gross margin turnover relation could be increased to 13.4 % (previous year 12.5%). In numbers: EUR 4.85 million compared to EUR 5.06 million in the previous year period. In the first half year, the EBITDA amounted to EUR 1.0 million against TEUR 415 in the period of the previous year. The group-wide operating result amounted to TEUR 315 in the first half year compared to TEUR -2 in the previous year period. In the second quarter, ARBOmedia reached a result after taxes of TEUR 356 against TEUR 27 in the same period of the previous year. On the basis of the half year, the company result after taxes thus amounted to TEUR 21 (period of previous year TEUR -70). The liquidity amounted to EUR 3.2 million as of 30 June 2004 (previous quarter EUR 4.2 million). This reduction is to be led back to the concentration of the advertising campaigns during the European Championship in June, of which the payments are only due in July. Accordingly, the accounts receivable are by EUR 2.6 million above the previous year. For the seasonally weakest 3rd quarter 2004, we expect a turnover of approx. EUR 12.8 million.

The world's second-largest system provider of precision components for the mobile-phone industry benefited heavily from its improved global position, diversification and its broad customer base. In the second quarter, revenues for the Group as a whole increased 56.0 percent, from 56.3 million euros to 87.8 million euros. Balda has attained a sales volume that tops the previous quarter by 25.0 percent. The cumulative growth rate in the first half of the year stands at 44.8 percent, reaching 158.1 million euros. In the second quarter, Balda consolidated the former Balda-Mikron joint venture in full, instead of at 50 percent, as it had previously done. After adjusting for this extraordinary effect, the Group's increase in revenues amounts to 31.6 percent in the first half-year, reaching 143.6 million euros. In the first half of the year, revenues in Europe rose 27.9 percent, to 124.5 million euros; in Asia, the Group generated revenues amounting to 35.2 million euros (plus 156.0 percent). This growth was driven predominantly by the steadily positive orders position in the core Infocom division and by the production of the volume orders that started as scheduled at the Asian production sites. These volume orders include the first clamshell-design mobile-phone that Siemens has ever developed completely in Asia. Year-on-year, consolidated operating results (EBIT) improved 105.7 percent between April and June, to 9.8 million euros (Q2 2003: 4.8 million euros). In the second quarter, EBIT increased 31.8 percent compared to the first three months of 2004. As a result, EBIT climbed 94.5 percent, to 17.3 million euros, in the first half of the year. Adjusted growth stands at 56.3 percent, reaching 13.9 million euros. Compared to the prior-year reference period, the EBIT margin improved significantly in the second quarter, from 8.4 percent to 10.8 percent. The cumulative operating margin increased in the first half-year from 7.7 percent to 10.6 percent. Pre-tax earnings (EBT), when compared with the second quarter of 2003, shot up 212.4 percent, to 8.7 million euros (Q2 2003: 2.8 million euros). At 14.9 million euros, cumulative EBT of the first half-year surpassed the reference period by 172.3 percent (previous year: 5.5 million euros). For the second quarter, Balda shows a significantly higher net income of 6.2 million euros (Q2 2003: 1.4 million euros). The net income for the half-year rose 263.3 percent. Amounting to 9.6 million euros, it clearly exceeded the prior period's results of 2.6 million euros. With a basis of 38.694 million shares, this translates into undiluted EPS for the second quarter amounting to 16.1 cents (Q2 2003: 4.0 cents for 33.72 million shares). Cumulative EPS in the first half of the year stands at 24.8 cents, up from 7.8 cents the year before (plus 217.9 percent). As of June 30th 2004, 5,650 employees were on the payrolls of the Balda Group, including, for the first time, more employees in Asia than in Europe. Following the positive business performance in the first half of the year and the set-up of the Balda Lumberg joint venture in Manaus, Brazil, and based on the customer forecast, the Board of Directors has increased its forecast for the overall year of 2004 once again. Accordingly, revenues are expected to grow between 35.6 and 37.4 percent, to reach 370 to 375 million euros. Pre-tax earnings are expected to rise between 44.7 and 53.5 percent and reach 33 to 35 million euros. Please see the semi-annual report at http://www.balda.de for detailed comments\",\n",

Concerning the legal patent infringement case about sky/cableDSL, TELES AG has achieved another important success: After the earlier agreement with Plenexis GmbH, yesterday also the Tellique Kommunikationstechnik GmbH settled an agreement with TELES. The decisive importance of this settlement: Tellique was the sole deliverer of the software system, because of the use of which TELES took SES/Astra - jointly with Deutsche Telekom AG - to the court due to patent infringement. The fundamental substance of the settlement TELES/Tellique is: - Tellique stops implementing/marketing the controversial technique and will not re-enter into this business before 2011. - Both sides withdraw their appeals against the first instance verdict of the Landgericht Mannheim as of 06.06.2003: This judgement, confirming TELES' position as a whole, therefore becomes legally binding also against Tellique - against Plenexis this has been the case already (see http://www.teles.de ). After this settlement with Tellique, TELES is conducting the patent infringement suit solely against DTAG and SES/Astra: But both of them are merely users of the controversial technique - i.e. neither its creator (TELES), nor its implementer (TELES, Tellique), nor its marketer (TELES, Tellique, Plenexis). The technically more likely qualified implementers/marketers of the controversial technique now have preferred, to smoothly settle the patent infringement case against TELES, the creator of this technology.

Munich, July 27, 2004. The DAB bank Group (Munich, www.dab-bank.de), which operates in Germany and Austria, generated a pretax profit of EUR2.903 million in the second quarter of 2004, representing a 30.2% increase over the corresponding prior-year quarter (Q2/2003: EUR2.230 million). Together with the EUR6.538 million generated in the first quarter of 2004, DAB bank earned a pretax profit of EUR9.441 million for the first half of 2004. The net financial income of EUR11.663 million (Q2/2003: EUR8.981 million), which was 29.9% higher than the corresponding prior-year quarter, made up for the lower net commission income, which fell 9.3% to EUR15.579 million (Q2/2003: EUR17.181 million). The total income of DAB bank rose 21.0% to reach EUR36.404 million (Q2/2003: EUR30.084 million). Moreover, total income was 2.4% higher than the very good figure for the first quarter of the year (Q1/2004: EUR35.563 million). DAB bank executed 816,535 trades for account of its customers, representing a 5.5% increase over the prior-year quarter (Q2/2003: 773,997), even though the total number of trades executed on the German stock exchanges was 7.9% lower than the prior-year figure. The number of trades executed for DAB bank customers was 18.7% than the figure for the preceding quarter (Q1/2004: 1,004,038), while the volume of shares traded on the German stock exchanges fell 27.6% over the same period. Thus, DAB bank has clearly gained market share. On an annualized basis, the number of trades per securities account per year was 7.09, surpassing the prior-year figure of 6.76. DAB bank invested an additional EUR3 million in marketing activities and strategic projects in the second quarter of 2004.

       " 'AT&S increases sales by 6%, EBIT by 60% and profit by more than 400%. AT&S AG, Vienna, Austria, 28 July 2004 In the first quarter of the 2004/05 financial year AT&S achieved sales of EUR 77.9m, around 6% up on the previous year. The EBIT was increased by 60% to EUR 6.4m compared to the first quarter of the last financial year. In the first quarter the EBIT margin therefore reached 8.2%. As a result of the current expansion of production capacities in the laser field for 2N2 technology the yield of AT&S should continue to rise and the margin situation should therefore also improve. The quarterly result before tax amounted to EUR 7.3m (+67%). The net income of Q1 2003/04 amounted to EUR 7.6m, which represents an increase of over 400%. The reason for this extraordinary rise in profit is not only a very good first quarter from the point of view of operations, but also one-time effects, such as the release of provisions for deferred taxes required as a result of the reduction in corporation tax from 34% to 25%. A strong financial result also was key to net income increase. In the first quarter of 2004/05 the earnings per share (EPS) were EUR 0.29 (EUR 0.05 in the first quarter of 2003/04). At the end of the first quarter the net indebtedness of AT&S was EUR 33.4m (EUR 57.9m one year ago). The gearing therefore reaches 15.9% with the qualifying date of 30 June 2004 (29.9% one year ago). This very satisfying first quarter of 2004/05 also gives us hope that the year as a whole will be very positive. The management therefore confirms its expectations of a growth in sales of at least 10% for the 2004/05 financial year and a significantly higher profit than in the past financial year. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 28.07.2004',\n",

       " 'EADS: Ad-hoc release, July 29, 2004 EADS results grow strongly in first half year EADS first half year EBIT* of Euro 985 million, up 66 percent Net Income more than doubled to Euro 387 million Thanks to market improvements, EADS increases its 2004 EBIT* target to about Euro 2.1 billion Free Cash Flow before customer financing remains robust at Euro 259 million EADS (stock exchange symbol: EAD), the world\\'s second largest aerospace and defence group, has achieved strong results growth in the first half year of 2004. The company reached an EBIT* (pre-goodwill and exceptionals) of Euro 985 million in the first six months, 66 percent higher than the figure for the same period of 2003 (Euro 592 million). The EBIT* margin has increased from 4.5 percent to 6.8 percent. The EBIT* improvement was particularly driven by Airbus, which delivered twelve aircraft more than in the same period last year with a higher proportion of A330/A340 family aircraft, and by the Space Division, which had already achieved close to break-even by mid-year. As usual, the Defence businesses are expected to contribute stronger results in the second half of the year. The Defence and Security Systems Division was held back, as previously announced, by a restructuring charge in the second quarter. Thanks to the market improvements particularly in civil aviation, EADS has increased its 2004 EBIT* target to about Euro 2.1 billion, up from the previous target of Euro 1.93 billion. Free Cash Flow before customer financing amounted to Euro 259 million in the first half year (H1 2003: Euro 305 million), reflecting the strong profits and a spill-over of aircraft deliveries into the year 2004. This performance was achieved after higher investment and inventory build-up by Airbus for the A380 and capital expenditures in Space related to Paradigm. EADS maintained its strong Net Cash position at Euro 2.9 billion (year-end 2003: Euro 3.1 billion). EADS paid about Euro 300 million of dividends to its shareholders in the second quarter of 2004. EADS recorded first half year Net Income of Euro 387 million (same period 2003 pre-goodwill: Euro 177 million), or Euro 0.48 per share (H1 2003: Euro 0.22). EADS revenues increased by 12 percent in the first six months to reach Euro 14.6 billion (first half year 2003: Euro 13.1 billion). Revenues increased in all Divisions except Military Transport Aircraft, where no A400M revenue milestone was recognised before July. Outlook EADS increases its 2004 EBIT* target to about Euro 2.1 billion from Euro 1.93 billion. At the same time, EADS raises its 2004 revenues target to Euro 31 billion (previously at Euro 29 to 30 billion), based on an average exchange market rate of EUR 1 = USD 1.20. These improvements should be achieved thanks to stronger contributions from the non-Airbus Divisions in the second half of the year. At the same time, Airbus deliveries will not be at the same level of the first half year, and aircraft mix is expected to be less favourable until year-end, with a lower delivery proportion of A330/A340 family aircraft. Following the recent improvements in market demand, Airbus now expects to deliver more than 305 aircraft in 2004, which was the 2003 level, and to increase significantly deliveries in the coming years. In the first half year 2004, Airbus has already delivered 161 aircraft. Responding to the market improvement, Airbus has also decided to implement a step-by-step production rate increase, which could reach up to eight A330/A340 family aircraft per month in 2005 and up to 30 A320 family aircraft per month in 2006. The pace and the implementation of this progressive ramp-up will be closely monitored and adjusted if needed in order to follow the actual market demand. In addition, EADS confirms its previous guidance that it will achieve a positive Free Cash Flow before customer financing in 2004. * EADS uses EBIT pre goodwill amortization and exceptionals as a key indicator to measure the economic performance of the Group and its Segments. The term \"exceptionals\" refers to income or expenses of a non-recurring nature, such as amortization expenses of fair value adjustments relating to the EADS merger, the Airbus combination and the formation of MBDA, as well as impairment charges',\n",

EUR 964.2 M or 76.7 % of total sales referred to multimedia products (previous year: 75.7 %). Sales in the entertainment and household electronics division amounted to EUR 267.8 M - this matches 21.3 % of total turnover (previous year: 22.4 %). In communications technology we achieved sales of EUR 24.8 M or 2.0 % of total group sales (previous year: 1.9 %). EBIT went down by 14.7 % from EUR 68.2 M to EUR 58.1 M. As the financial aid to victims of flooding in Germany has been omitted tax ratio has shrunk. Thus net earnings have been shrinking at a lower rate from EUR 39.2 M the year before to EUR 33.9 M.

With the growth rate having climbed from 20.3 % in Q1 2004 to 25.6 % in Q2 our European sales have developed very favorably. On our overseas markets we have generated a sales increase in the first six months of 2004 of 27.7 % from EUR 36.4 M to EUR 46.5 M. Outlook At the present time we have to expect that the negative consumer climate in Germany, and thus the factors which affect our business, will not improve in the near future. Therefore, we will further strengthen our foreign expansion and will optimize our cost structures. Moreover we will intensify our efforts to make innovative trend consumer electronic products, which offer an optimal cost- benefit ratio, ready for launch on mass markets. Coming to an overall assessment for the time being, we have to state that the sales and earnings projections we had made at the beginning of the year have proved to be too ambitious. In the case of the overall environment not stabilizing in Germany, declines in both sales and earnings even on a full year basis can no longer be completely excluded. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 29.07.2004',\n",

Revenues equaled 1.73 million Euros, up 19% from the second quarter 2003 results and 17% higher than revenues recognized in the period ended March 31, 2004. EBITDA losses before restructuring costs reduced to 258,000 Euros from 1.46 million Euros in the year ago period. \\'We saw the momentum continue to grow in the wealth management space\\', stated Rocco Pellegrinelli, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Brainpower. \\'Our new business for the quarter included a three-year global deal with HSBC Private Bank and also a three-year deal with Banque Cantonale de Geneve. In addition, there was also interest from integrators now recommending our products as part of their overall wealth management solution. We continued our collaboration with third parties by creating a \"best practices\" laboratory for the Italian asset management community with Sungard and CapGemini. The company also signed a further agreement with a third party service provider, who will utilize our technology within one of their new products. Overall we are happy to see that the recently expanded product range has translated into increased visibility for our company in the market place, resulting in a significantly expanded new business pipeline for the second half of the year.\\' Bill Holwell, Chief Financial Officer of Brainpower, added, \\'As previously stated, the shift by some clients from term to perpetual licenses with upfront fees is causing some revenue variability on a quarterly basis. We anticipate this trend to continue moving forward but still expect to see quarterly revenue expansion due to the strength of our product portfolio. The trend toward perpetual licenses has also had an impact on Brainpower\\'s total backlog of booked revenue to be recognized over the next two to three years. At the end of the second quarter this backlog equaled EUR6.8 million, down slightly from EUR6.9 million at March 31, 2004. As expected, cash used in operations during the quarter of 649,000 Euros was higher than the previous quarter but down from 1.6 million Euros used in the second quarter of 2003. As previously mentioned, this is principally due to our six-monthly invoicing pattern, which results in cash collections from customers being higher in the first and third quarters of the year.

Under the terms of the proposal, the Integralis business within Articon- Integralis will merge with the Harrier business in exchange for an issue of new ordinary shares in the Harrier Group. The proposed merger will form a market- leading security systems integrator with considerable potential for further growth to be traded on the AIM market under the name Harrier-Integralis plc. Following the transaction, it is intended that Articon-Integralis AG will become an investment company known just as Articon AG, with at least EUR7m cash and ownership of 75% of the issued share capital of the newly formed Harrier- Integralis plc. The final details of the proposed merger are currently being negotiated between the Management Boards of Articon-Integralis AG and Harrier Group plc, but the proposal has the approval of the Articon-Integralis Supervisory Board. Once negotiations are complete, shareholder approval will be sought at an Extraordinary General Meeting to be held in late October or early November 2004. In addition, the shareholders of Harrier Group plc must confirm the merger according to the rules of the AIM market. Articon-Integralis will announce full results for quarter two of 2004 on 10 August 2004, and preliminary estimates indicate revenues of EUR21.8 million and an EBITDA loss (pre-exceptionals) of EUR0.6 million. Harrier is also due to announce its results for the first half of 2004 in August 2004, and preliminary indications are for revenues in the half year of £6 million with an EBITDA profit of £0.295 million. The circumstances indicated at Harrier's Annual General Meeting relating to reductions in gross margins continue and as a result, the board of Harrier notes that profit before tax, but not revenues, for the year ended 31 December 2004 is expected to be below their expectations. Based on audited 2003 revenues, the new Harrier-Integralis plc would have had, on a pro-forma basis, combined revenues of approximately EUR100 million. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 29.07.2004\",\n",
       " \"DaimlerChrysler increases Group operating profit in second quarter Stuttgart/Auburn Hills - DaimlerChrysler (stock-exchange abbreviation DCX) has substantially increased its second quarter operating profit from EUR0.6 billion to EUR2.1 billion. The Chrysler Group, Commercial Vehicles and Services divisions significantly improved their earnings, though the operating profits of the Mercedes Car Group and the Other Activities segment were lower than in the same period of last year. Net income for the second quarter amounted to EUR554 million (Q2 2003: EUR109 million). The generally positive development of the Group's operative business was partially offset by a negative impact of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's net loss in its 2003/04 financial year. The impact on the net income of DaimlerChrysler totaled EUR0.5 billion. Earnings per share rose from EUR0.11 to EUR0.55. The Mercedes Car Group's operating profit of EUR703 million was lower than in Q2 2003. This is mainly the result of the lifecycle-related decrease in unit sales by Mercedes-Benz, high launch costs and start-up costs for new products, as well as the continuation of the quality offensive. With an operating profit of EUR516 million, the Chrysler Group posted a positive operating result for the fourth consecutive quarter. This strong improvement is mainly due to the market success of the new products, higher units sales and further cost reductions. With a second quarter operating profit of EUR472 million, Services significantly surpassed last year's good result (+41%). The key factors behind the increase were the improved profitability of the division's entire portfolio and the reduced need for risk provisioning. The Other Activities segment posted an operating profit of EUR85 million (Q2 2003: EUR217 million). The decrease is primarily due to the negative contribution from Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (positive in the prior-year's second quarter) and the fact that there was no contribution from the former business unit MTU Aero Engines, which was sold as of December 31, 2003. Based on the divisions' assessments, DaimlerChrysler expects to achieve a significant improvement in operating profit for the full year compared with 2003 (excluding restructuring expenditures at the Chrysler Group and excluding the capital gain realized on the sale of MTU Aero Engines). end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 29.07.2004\",\n",

In the VAIS Segment (VAIS = Value Added Internet Services) Revenues increased substantially, while Revenues in the TCS-Segment (TCS = TELES Communications Systems) amounted to yet slightly below Q2/2003 but far above Q1/2004. The Adjusted Total Earnings in Q2/2004 came close to those of Q2/2003 - adjusted in Q2/2003 for annual reimbursement on goods and in Q1/2004 for forerunning operational expenses due to expected significant growth of Revenues in 2004. While the Q1/2004 benchmark figures were weak, those of Q2/2004 showed a strong upside trend again (according to IFRS and not audited): - Revenues: 21.1 MioEUR (in Q2/03: 18.6 MioEUR, +14% and in Q1/04: 18.0 MioEUR, +17%), - Gross Profit: 12.6 MioEUR (in Q2/03: 12.2 MioEUR, +4% and in Q1/04: 11.5 MioEUR, +10%), - EBITDA: 4.0 MioEUR (in Q2/03: 5.5 MioEUR, -28% and in Q1/04: 2.9 MioEUR, +38%), - EBIT: 2.3 MioEUR (in Q2/03: 4.1 MioEUR, -43% and in Q1/04: 1.4 MioEUR, +62%), - EBT: 2.6 MioEUR (in Q2/03: 4.2 MioEUR, -39% and in Q1/04: 1.7 MioEUR, +53%).

For meeting its original Earnings prognosis - the EPS to increase by 30% to 0.65 EUR/share - it should be possible to make use of hidden Reserves. Two further very important benchmark figures are to be emphasized: - The TELES Group\\'s Free Cash still amounted to 44.7 MioEUR by the end of Q2/2004 (49.9 MioEUR at the end of Q1/2004) - despite approximately 2 MioEUR in stock repurchases during the period under review, i.e. a total of approximately 20 MioEUR in stock repurchases since Q2/2003, with continued very low liability. - By this date, its Equity Ratio remained at an extremely comfortable 60% (60% at the end of Q1/2004), with risks on the asset side remaining very low. These positive Results for Q2/2004 were achieved in spite of: - operational start-up costs of TEIA, - delays in the business area \"broad-band Internet access\", although with strong growth acceleration in Q2/2004, - the above mentioned forerunning operational expenses due to 2004 Revenues growth.

The company's order intake and revenues for the second quarter as well as the entire first half of 2004 rose markedly over the comparable preceding-year periods. The order backlog rose significantly. The 146.4 million Euro order intake for Q2/2004 exceeded expectations when compared to Q2/2003 (97.0 million Euro). The total order intake of 297.6 million Euro for the first half of 2004 resulted in a 31.9 % gain over the 225.6 million Euro prior-year figure. Order intake projections were surpassed, particularly for replication lines and mastering systems, with bookings received for 193 DVD 9 and 42 DVD-R lines. By the 06/30/04 closing date, the order backlog totaled 215.9 million Euro (prior year 144.9 million Euro), up 49 % over 2003. At 91 million Euro, revenues for the 2nd quarter 2004 exceeded the Q2/2003 figures (82.2 million Euro). Revenues of 160.4 million Euro for the first half of the year surpassed the 139.2 million Euro prior-year half-year revenues by 15.2 %. The revenue share of prerecorded DVD 9 replication lines for the second quarter has not yet exceeded the equivalent prior-year period. Earnings before interest and depreciation (EBIT) totaled 9.0 million Euro for Q2 2004, a 4.1 million Euro gain over Q1 earnings (4.9 million Euro). A mid-year comparison reveals that the 13.8 million Euro EBIT is still 7.6 million Euro below the prior-year figure. This is attributable to the much lower number of DVD 9 lines booked during the first half-year 2004 versus the equivalent prior- year period. Only a portion of the high order intake for this business segment had been delivered, the balance of which will be accounted for in the third and fourth quarters of the year. This contributed to earnings of 9.6 million Euro being still below prior-year figures (14 million Euro). The gross margin rose from 27.3 % in the first quarter to 29.3 % in the 2nd quarter of the year and is calculated at 28.6 % for the first half of the year (prior year first half 32.5 %). Forecast As the global technology leader among optical data storage replication line manufacturers, SINGULUS TECHNOLOGIES continues to benefit from a strong economy in this industry. Project activity was gratifyingly robust, particularly in the DVD sectors. The company's market position continues to be reinforced in all vital business segments. In the months ahead, R&D activities will concentrate on new optical disc formats. Intensive efforts are underway on a system variation that will manufacture the 8.5 Gbyte storage-capacity dual layer DVD+R. Consumers will be able to record extended DVD-quality movies for the first time using this disc. Furthermore, investments in the new HD-DVD (high density, 15 Gbyte storage DVD) and Blu-Ray Disc (25 Gbyte storage capacity) will be further intensified. Efforts will be concentrated on the development of new in-line replication systems in the months ahead. Discussions with potential development and cooperation partners as well as pilot customers have already been initiated. As in years past, a significant gain in revenue is projected for the 2nd half of 2004. The company reconfirms the expectations for the full year 2004 that revenues will grow by a double-digit figure and EBIT-growth will be single digit. 02.08.2004\",\n",

At the midway point of the year, the EBITDA stood at EUR 1.82 million (previous year: TEUR 546) with turnover of EUR 31.80 million (previous year: EUR 28.46 million). The Executive Board regards these results as well within the target values set for fiscal year 2004. The first-half rise in turnover of 11.7 percent was slightly above the increase of 10.0 percent planned for the year as a whole. The EBITDA recorded at the half-yearly stage amounted to 40.5 percent of the EUR 4.50 million envisaged for the entire year. In previous years, only 18.2 percent (in 2003) and 32.1 percent (in 2002) of the EBITDA for the whole year had been earned by the six-month point. The Professional Services business area succeeded in raising sales by 4.0 percent to EUR 25.58 million (previous year: EUR 24.59 million), thus achieving a segment EBIT of TEUR 985, 70.0 percent above the previous year's value of TEUR 580. In the second quarter, the Communication Networks business area demonstrated the sustainability of the turnaround established during the first quarter. A segment EBIT of TEUR 374 (previous year: TEUR -310) was achieved thanks to a sales increase of 13.4 percent to EUR 2.74 million (previous year: EUR 2.41 million). With turnover of EUR 3.49 million (previous year: EUR 1.46 million), the Financial Solutions business area recorded a segment EBIT of TEUR 358 (previous year: TEUR -270). Owing to the fact that this segment has only belonged to the Brain Force Software group since 1st May 2003, comparisons with the previous year are only possible to a limited degree.

       " \"KRONES achieves significant growth in order bookings and sales Increased costs put a brake on rise in earnings The healthy trend in the global business cycle is also showing up among export- driven German companies. In these macro-economic conditions, KRONES, the world's largest producer of beverage bottling/canning lines and packaging machinery, with exports accounting for around 80 % of its turnover, reported further improvements in its key figures for the 1st half of 2004 as well: Order bookings rose by 18.2 % to euros 784.9 m (Jan.-June 2003: euros 663.9 m). Particularly high growth was reported in the regions of North America, Asia/Pacific and in the former CIS nations. Sales improved by 8.0 % to reach euros 775.1 m (Jan.-June 2003: euros 717.5 m). Earnings before interest and taxes showed a modestly overproportional rise of 9.3 %, to euros 58.7 m (Jan.-June 2003: euros 53.7 m). The increase in earnings after taxes, however, did not keep pace with the growth in sales. During the first half of 2004, net income showed a modest rise of 1.7 % to reach euros 35.0 m (Jan.-June 2003: euros 34.4 m). Return on sales was hit primarily by the steep increases in the price of raw materials, and higher wage costs as well. Due to the continuing price war, these cost hikes could not be passed on to the customers. To ensure that its competitive position in the international market is maintained and indeed strengthened, KRONES will inevitably have to start considering whether to relocate some production operations to facilities abroad or introduce longer and more flexible working hours. In the group, which on June 30, 2004, was employing 8,724 people (+0.5 %), capital expenditure during the first half of this year, at euros 13.5 m, was 44 % less than in the preceding year's equivalent period (euros 24.3 m). With sales up once again, and orders on hand amounting on June 30, 2004, to euros 629.2 m, 12.3 % above last year's like-for-like figure, KRONES will in 2004 still be maintaining its front-ranking position on the world market. Sales for 2004 as a whole will continue within the bandwidth of between five and ten percent the company has projected for the years ahead. After sales of euros 1.435 bn in the preceding year, KRONES anticipates a figure exceeding euros 1.55 bn for 2004 as a whole. Following a net income of euros 60.3 m in 2003, KRONES regards further improvement in earnings as achievable, though as a percentage it will not keep pace with the growth in sales. Brief portrait: the KRONES Group The KRONES Group is headquartered in Neutraubling/Upper Palatinate, Germany; it plans, develops and manufactures machines and complete lines for bottling, canning and packaging processes in the beverage, food, chemical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. It operates plants in Neutraubling, Nittenau, Flensburg, Freising and Rosenheim. Besides KRONES AG (M-DAX), the group also includes the production subsidiaries Steinecker (brewing technology), Sander Hansen (pasteurisers), Syskron (process automation) and Kosme (machines for the lower output range), plus more than 40 companies abroad, which ensure comprehensive service support during a line's entire lifetime. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 03.08.2004\",\n",
       " \"Softing concludes first half-year on a positive note The Softing Group continued to achieve improvements in terms of incoming orders, sales revenue and earnings. In the second quarter, Softing recorded global sales of EUR 4.8 million (2003: EUR 4.6 million). This brings the Group's sales revenue for the first half-year to EUR 9.6 million (2003: EUR 9.4 million). Softing's operating loss in the second quarter came in at EUR 52 thousand (2003: EUR 0.6 million). In the first two quarters of the current fiscal year, Softing recorded an operating profit of EUR 38 thousand (2003: operating loss of EUR 0.7 million). The consistent improvement of the company's cost structure, coupled with increased sales, is making a significant impact. Softing also recorded a small net income of EUR 6 thousand (2003: net loss of EUR 0.5 million) in what continued to be a difficult overall economic situation in Germany and Europe. At EUR 4.5 million, the incoming orders in the Softing Group in the second quarter of 2004 were at previous year's level; they totaled EUR 9.8 million overall in the first half-year (2003: EUR 9.3 million). This represents an increase of more than 5 percent. Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2004 amounted to EUR 5.1 million, which was on par with the previous year's figure. Compared to the first quarter of 2004, cash and cash equivalents decreased by EUR 0.7 million, which is primarily due to the reduction of long-term liabilities. At the end of the second quarter of 2004, the Group's equity was EUR 11.9 million. This translates to EUR 2.38 per Softing share based on the current share price of approximately EUR 2.20.

Catalis N.V. will contribute assets worth EUR 4.0 million to Navigator Equity Solutions N.V. representing ~ EUR 0.28 per Catalis N.V. share. The spin-off ratio will be 1:1 resulting in each shareholder of Catalis N.V. owning one share in Navigator Equity Solutions N.V. for each one share in Catalis N.V.. Each shareholder will continue to own his shares in Catalis N.V. The relevant date for the split and the respective ownership in Catalis N.V. shares will be published in due course.

Dutch tax authorities have accordingly granted exemption from dividend taxes conditional to the build up of such new business and the introduction of the new company to trading at an European stock exchange. The company is convinced to unlock value for all shareholders through this measure. Furthermore both companies will have full flexibility to develop the respective businesses. It is planned to introduce shares in Navigator Equity Solutions N.V. in a timely fashion after the split in order to allow all shareholders to participate in capital growth and future development.

       " 'Strong growth in sales and earnings in the first half year 2004 Dusseldorf, August 03, 2004 - The sales development of DIS AG gained further momentum in the second quarter of 2004. After sales growth of 14.0 percent in the first quarter, sales increased by 21.9 percent to EUR 62.7 million in the second quarter. This is equivalent to sales growth of 17.8 percent to EUR 124.2 million in the first half of 2004. As in the first quarter, the gross margin developed considerably better than expected in the second quarter. What happened was that the additional expenses in subsegments of the Industry and Office & Management business divisions which resulted from the introduction of the collective wage agreement were more than compensated for. In the second quarter, the gross margin increased by 270 basis points, to 35.5 percent, following the increase by 40 basis points in the first quarter. In view of a continued dynamic development of sales, the increase of gross margin and a good cost structure, the company raised the EBIT margin considerably during the quarter reported, by 4.5 percent to 7.5 percent, equivalent to EBIT growth of 204.0 percent to EUR 4.7 million. This results in an EBIT increase of 114.6 percent to EUR 10.3 million for the first half of 2004, which considerably exceeds the budgeted figure for the first half of 2004. Against the background of the considerably better than expected business development, the Board of Management is raising its sales forecast for the 2004 financial year from the previous figure of EUR 250.0 million to at least EUR 255.0 million, equivalent to sales growth of a good 17 percent. The earnings before tax forecast has been increased by 16.6 percent to EUR 22.5 million (previously: EUR 19.3 million). DIS AG is thus anticipating sales growth of a good 17 percent and a strong earnings improvement of 46 percent. The full report is available under http://www.dis-ag.com',\n",

The EBIT was -8.6 million euros (2003: -1.3 million euros) in the first six months. The consolidated result for 30 June 2004 was -8.9 million euros (2003: -1.1 million euros). These include a one-off burden of 4.2 million euros from a lawsuit from 2000 and the loss of expected licensing income of 1.2 million euros in the telecommunications business. The number of employees decreased to 1,144 (30 June 2003: 1, 242) as of 30 June. The segment Network Management (energy, telecommunication, traffic) suffered once again under the delayed investments in the expansion of the UMTS infrastructure and continuing uncertainties about the regulation of the gas market.

Without the effect from the lawsuit this corresponds to an improvement on -0.3 million euros. New orders increased significantly in June again following slow months in April and May and reached 61 million euros in the first six months. The positive trend of the previous month stabilized itself in the beginning of the third quarter. In July, normally a slow month, new orders totaled 9 million euros, about 20 % above the same period for 2003. With 68 million euros, the order books on 30 June were about one million above the same day last year. The Group equity capitalization on 30 June 2004 was 36%. The liquidity of 11.6 million euros on 30 June 2004 (2003: 20.4 million euros) will increase in the course of the second half of the year. To utilize synergy effects in Information Management, all the activities of the segment have been merged into one business unit. In the second quarter as well PSI continued to expand the control systems business in Information Management and continued to demonstrate progress. In the 3rd quarter, the new PSIpenta version 7 will be launched. With the successful conclusion of the first projects on the basis of the new network management products for the mobile communications and gas markets at the end of the second quarter, the prerequisites for an improved business in the fields of telecommunication and gas have been established. PSI will increase the efforts toward the improvement of the sales and cost structure in the course of the structural improvement program.

Second Quarter 2004 orders are the highest level realized in the last three years. Order Entry for the first half year of 2004 is EUR 60,5 million or 20% above First Half 2003 Orders of EUR 50,3 million. Throughout the year, there has been a favourable shift in orders towards production machines in our Advanced Packaging and the Microsystems Technology market. Sales in Q2/2004 rose 23% compared to Q2/2003. In the first half year, sales grew 17% with respect to previous year. At the end of June order backlog amounted to EUR 48.7 million; 20% up compared to June 2003. This growth in order backlog led to a slight increase in inventory (plus EUR 1.6 million compared to Q1/2004), however, a significant reduction is expected during the second half of 2004 in conjunction with increased sales numbers. Free Cash Flow in Q2 2004 was EUR -1.0 million. The key figures at a glance (previous year figures in brackets): Net sales: EUR 26.6 (21.6) million, +23%. Gross profit: EUR 9.9 (9.5) million, +5%. Gross margin: 37.4 (43.8)%. The Q2 gross margin was still a bit weak, but with increasing utilization rate and a shift in product mix we expect improvements during the second half of the year. EBITDA improved to EUR -1.1 (-2.7) million. There are ongoing positive developments in our important markets Advanced Packaging and Microsystems Technology. The trend to shift the wafer bumping from the chip manufacturers towards packaging foundries should result in continued new investments by the foundries. SUSS MicroTec expects to benefit from this trend and anticipates increased levels of order entry from the foundries in the next quarters. For the fiscal year 2004 we reiterate our fore- cast of a positive EBIT which currently is achieved with sales in the range of EUR 115 to 120 million. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 03.08.2004\",\n",

       " 'KarstadtQuelle AG: Restructuring progr. being implemented; sales and earnings expectations adjusted The KarstadtQuelle Management Board will take extensive measures in the third quarter of 2004 on the basis of the outcomes of a comprehensive corporate appraisal. Their main thrust will be the clear refocusing of the KarstadtQuelle Group on its retailing operations. They will mainly include a fast programme to stabilise sales, stringent cost management, the improvement of the gross margin, disinvestments, portfolio adjustments and the transformation of the department store and universal mail order business models. These measures will additionally and have a one-off impact on earnings in the third quarter of 2004, but, if achieved as expected, will on balance have no significant effect on the liquidity position of the group in the 2004 financial year. The aim of the package of measures is the consistent restructuring and reorientation of the KarstadtQuelle Group to put it back squarely on the road to growth and profitability in the coming years. As announced, the Management Board will present this new strategic orientation to the public at the end of September of the current year. KarstadtQuelle Group sales decreased by 6 % to 6.87 bill. EUR in the first half of 2004 (previous year: 7.31 bill. EUR). In the first six months group operating (adjusted) EBTA amounted to minus 388.5 mill. EUR (previous year: minus 289.3 mill. EUR). This earnings decrease of 99.2 mill. EUR is less than could have been expected given the reduction in sales of 438 mill. EUR, due to the efficiency and effectiveness of our programmes, particularly our cost cutting programme. EBTA for the previous year was affected by extra-ordinary income, which makes an earnings comparison difficult. This income resulted from the reorganisation of the old-age pension provision and came to 235 mill. EUR. Furthermore, both the current and the previous year include non-recurring costs of achieving greater flexibility and portfolio adjustment costs. Taking into account the special factors mentioned, EBTA for the first half-year stood at minus 439.5 mill. EUR (previous year: minus 97.3 mill. EUR). The optimisation of net financial debt and working capital has progressed well in past weeks and despite the difficult retail environment is already showing considerable success. Proof of this is that the sluggish progress of business in the first half year did not negatively affect the net financial debt. This is due, amongst other things, to the reduction of working capital by 27 % to 2.2 bill. EUR. Still unsatisfactory, on the other hand, is the development of free cash flow. Because of the sales and earnings performance in the second quarter of 2004 and the continuing weak domestic economy the Management Board has lowered its expectations for the 2004 financial year. Although on the basis of the present level of knowledge and forecasts we expect a slight improvement in the sales performance in the second half of the year, nevertheless group sales for the 2004 financial year will be between 4,5 % and 5 % lower than those of the previous year. On this basis the Management Board anticipates in the 2004 financial year operating earnings (EBTA, not including extraordinary restructuring costs) of between minus 160 mill. EUR and minus 200 mill.

Because Leighton is a fully consolidated subsidiary-HOCHTIEF holds a 53 percent stake-this would put HOCHTIEF's end-2004 consolidated net income slightly above and pretax profit about ten percent below prior-year levels. But because goodwill ceases to be amortizable from 2004 under IFRS 3, from today's perspective both earnings measures are set to at least match the figures originally budgeted for.

The Nemetschek Group, one of the leading vendors of software and consulting services for the design, construction and management of buildings and real estate, pursues its growth course in the first half of 2004 and increases both sales and profit. As per June 30, group sales increased by 2.8 % to 46.4 million euros (previous year: 45.2 million euros). The foreign subsidiaries in particular were the driving force behind this growth. The group operating profit increased by 31 % to 2.5 million euros (previous year: 1.9 million euros). This positive development was also reflected in the net income for the year, which Nemetschek was able to improve to 1.6 million euros (previous year: 1.2 million euros; + 26 %). The earnings per share thus increased from 0.13 euros to 0.16 euros. The earnings per share amounts to 0.33 euros before goodwill amortization (previous year: 0.30 euros) The technology group has increased its liquid assets by 4.8 million euros to 34.6 million euros since the beginning of the year (December 31, 2003: 29.8 million euros). The balance sheet total is 87.9 million euros (December 31, 2003: 83.7 million euros). Equity amounts to 56.2 million euros and the equity ratio is 64% (December 31, 2003: 65%). These solid reserves give the group the possibility to pay a dividend of approx. 0.45 euros for the current fiscal year. Nemetschek is thus offering a dividend yield of around 6%. For the current fiscal year Chairman of the Managing Board Gerhard Weiß anticipates a further drop in construction spending in Germany. The Board thus sees growth opportunities primarily in its international sales. New software releases will make significant, positive contributions in sales, which will mainly have an effect in Q4.

       " 'Marburg, 04 August 2004 - In the course of preparing the half year report of 3U TELECOM AG it has become apparent that the original forecast of EUR 100 Mn. sales and EUR 1 earnings per share (respectively EUR 0.20 after stock split conducted in July 2004) from the operating business (without consolidation of LambdaNet Communications Deutschland AG) will presumably not be achievable. This is mainly due to the overall weakening market and competitive environment in the telecommunication industry which experiences further decreasing margins due to the increasing price battle. Against this background the management is examining the planned product introductions. The exact extent of the forecast variation can not be numeralized yet. Currently the corporate planning for all corporate areas is being revised. Since 02 August 2004 the management of 3U has been strengthened by Dr. Michael Späth, who was appointed as general agent and will primarily be responsible for the finance area. Dr. Späth (40) has long experience in the corporate finance area at Price Waterhouse and as partner at Arthur Andersen and has been active in the telecommunication industry for 10 years. The half year report of 3U TELECOM AG will be published by 16 August 2004 according to plan',\n",

       " \"First-half figures confirm full-year projections for 2004 itelligence AG has announced an operating result (EBIT) of EUR 2.9 million (2003: EUR -3.2 million) and an EBIT margin of 4.5 percent (2003: -4.4 percent) for the first half of 2004. The operating result for the second quarter amounted to EUR 1.7 million (2003: EUR -2.6 million), which represents an EBIT margin of 5.3 percent (2003: -7.2 percent). The IT full-service provider thus continued the positive trend of the previous three quarters thanks to an improved structural and operational positioning, optimized capacity utilization and stricter cost management. Group results to US-GAAP increased by EUR 8.3 million from EUR -6.8 million in the first half of 2003 to EUR 1.5 million in the first six months of 2004. As expected total second-quarter sales, at EUR 31.7 million, were down approx. 13 percent on the previous year's EUR 36.3 million. Total sales for the first six months of 2004 amounted to EUR 64.4 million (2003: EUR 73.2 million). Net of exchange rate differences, revenues were on a par with the first half of 2003, adjusted for discontinued operations and companies/business units that have been closed. At EUR 7.1 million, license sales were up 0.4 percent on the first-half of 2003 in currency-adjusted terms. Sales from consulting activities declined by EUR 4.5 million to EUR 39.4 million, while sales in the Outsourcing & Services division were up EUR 4.2 million. Sales in Germany, the Company's core market, were up approx. 2 percent on the first half of 2003. By contrast, revenues in the rest of Europe were down 5.6 percent on the comparative prior-year figures (down 3.0 percent net of exchange rate effects) and revenues were down 10.8 percent on the comparative prior-year figures in the Americas (down 1.2 percent net of exchange rate effects). Benefiting from the improved earnings position and the capital increase, the equity ratio increased to 34 percent (2003: 18 percent) at Group level. The interest bearing debt to total assets ratio is at 19 percent at the end of the second quarter, a significant improvement from the previous year's 30 percent.

       " \"Varetis invests in the future: New business strategy puts temporary strain on half-year result Munich, August 5, 2004 - In the first half of 2004, Varetis AG realized turnover of 6.7 million Euros (1st half-year 2003: EUR 9.1 Mio). Turnover in the second quarter amounted to 3.2 million Euros (Q2 2003: 5.0 million Euros). For the first six months of 2004, the company's result before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) was minus 1.6 million Euros (1st half-year 2003: -0.9 million Euros) The first half-year 2004 closed with a result before interest and taxes (EBIT) of minus 1.9 million Euros (1st half year 2003: -1.3 million Euros). The operating loss as of June 30, 2004 is minus 1.8 million Euros (1st half-year 2003: -1.2 million Euros). The business shift toward transaction-based models is responsible for the regressive turnover in the first half-year 2004. Turnover per customer immediately following implementation of a Varetis system is relatively marginal. As soon as a system is operative, Varetis earns with every call and every SMS handled by it. In the long run, transaction-based sales models will positively influence the company's turnover results. The EBIT of the first half year 2004 is negatively influenced by start-up costs of 0.4 million Euros for the new find engine, which will be launched this coming October\",\n",
       " \"RATIONAL AG: Outstanding second quarter growth: Sales up 17% - Earnings (EBT) up 10% - World's first SelfCooking Center(R) launched The second quarter of 2004 saw the highly successful international launch by RATIONAL AG of an entirely new product technology, in the shape of the world's first SelfCooking Center(R). This is impressively reflected in the 17% sales growth, from EUR45.0 to EUR52.5 million. As a result, sales in the first half of 2004 are up by 11% to EUR97.8 million (previous year EUR88.2 million). With sales growth of 60% in the second quarter, America, which is one of RATIONAL's most important markets for the future, continued its particularly strong performance. In the first half year, 37% of group growth was achieved in the American market. Despite one-off expenses for conversion of production facilities and the launch of the new SelfCooking Center(R), the second quarter of 2004 saw earnings before taxes (EBT) reach EUR11.0 million (previous year EUR10.1 million). This was 10% up on the previous year. At 21% the EBT margin is significantly ahead of expectations. In the first half of 2004, EBT was EUR18.9 million (previous year EUR17.6 million). This equates to an EBT margin of 19% (previous year 20%). Outlook Based on business trends to date, the company is optimistic of achieving both the planned 10% increase in sales to EUR205 million (previous year EUR187 million) and a proportional increase in earnings (EBIT) to EUR47 million (previous year EUR42 million) for 2004 as a whole\",\n",
       " 'HVB Group achieved a clear earnings improvement in the second quarter of 2004. At EUR 359 million, its operating profit increased nearly 24% compared to the EUR 290 million posted in the previous quarter. The figures presented today are, in particular, characterized by clear progress with respect to net interest income and considerably lower loan loss provisions. Consequently, HVB is able to present a significantly higher profit of EUR 155 mn on both a quarter-on- quarter and year-on-year basis. Compared to the first quarter (EUR 1,285 million), net interest income increased very clearly in the second quarter, by 13.1% to EUR 1,453 million. The expected positive influences from the capital increase completed at the beginning of the quarter contributed to this result, too. The second quarter also included non- recurrent seasonal and one-off effects totaling EUR 75 million. Overall, it becomes clear that HVB Group recorded an earnings improvement that will have a sustainable effect. At the mid-year mark, net interest income amounted to EUR 2,738 million, which is 0.7% above the previous year\\'s figure (EUR 2,720 million). Net commission income came to EUR 692 million in the second quarter, which nearly corresponds to the favorable performance recorded in the first three months (EUR 701 million). At EUR 1,393 million, it exceeded the prior-year level (EUR 1,267 million) by 9.9% at the end of June 2004. In a more difficult capital market environment, trading profit did no reach the high level recorded in the first quarter (EUR 262 million), coming in at EUR 182 million. The result after the first half of 2004 is thus EUR 444 million, which is 8.6% below the prior-year level (EUR 486 million). Compared to the result of the first three months, which included the disposal gain for Bankhaus BethmannMaffei of EUR 53 million, the balance of other operating income and expenses declined to EUR 22 million in the second quarter. In a year-on-year comparison, the balance stood at EUR 91 million, which is 85.7% above the prior-year level (EUR 49 million). Total operating revenues increased 1.4% to EUR 2,349 million, in the second quarter, compared to EUR 2,317 million (including disposal gain of EUR 53 million) in the previous quarter. On a year-on-year basis, they increased 3.2%, from EUR 4,522 million to EUR 4,666 million. At EUR 1,571 million, administrative expenses edged up slightly in the second quarter (Q1: EUR 1,542 million). This increase is virtually exclusively due to one-time integration costs for Vereins- und Westbank, which will burden the income statement of the current fiscal year 2004 with an amount of EUR 40 million. In a six-month comparison, administrative expenses of EUR 3,113 million were 1.2% above the prior-year level (EUR 3,077 million). The cost-income ratio came to 66.7% at the end of June (previous quarter: 66.6%). Whereas HVB Group still projected loan loss provisions of EUR 1,940 million after the first quarter, it was now possible to reduce the risk provisioning budget for full-year 2004 noticeably, to EUR 1,809 million. Apart from a macroeconomic easing of tensions, this is due to the success of our stringent risk management. Because the full-year projection is posted on a pro-rata basis, the figure for the first six months amounts to EUR 904 million (-20.9% versus the prior-year level of EUR 1,143 million). on a stand-alone basis, loan loss provisions in the second quarter thus declined substantially versus the first quarter, from EUR 485 million to EUR 419 million. At EUR 359 million, the second-quarter operating profit significantly exceeded the result of the first three months (EUR 290 million), advancing 23.8%. After six months, operating profit more than doubled, to EUR 649 million, compared to the prior-year level (EUR 302 million). This means that the operating performance of HVB Group continued to improve noticeably. In the second quarter, net income from investments of EUR 120 million included disposal gains for our participations in Brau und Brunnen and E.ON. At the mid- year mark, it amounted to EUR 139 million. Expenses for the amortization of goodwill came to EUR 39 million in the second quarter and EUR 77 million in the first six months. Other income and expenses of EUR -104 million in the second quarter and EUR -176 million at the end of June included pro-rata risk sheltering for Hypo Real Estate Group, which may amount to a maximum of EUR 130 million in the current year. In addition, this item also included higher absorbed losses for companies attributable to the Workout Real Estate segment. Pre-tax profit amounted to EUR 336 million in the second quarter, substantially surpassing the first-quarter result (EUR 199 million). At EUR 535 million in the first half of the year, it more than tripled compared to the prior-year level (EUR 165 million). After taxes and minority interests, HVB Group generated a profit of EUR 155 million in the second quarter - a figure nearly three times as high as in the previous quarter (EUR 53 million). The profit for the first six months was EUR 208 million, compared to a loss of EUR 20 million in same period of the previous year. HVB Group leaves its targets for fiscal 2004 as a whole unchanged. At the end of June, HVB Group had already reached some of its pro-rata target ranges. Additional positive earnings stimuli can be expected in the second half of the year due to the consistent implementation of activities aimed at boosting revenues, winning new customers and sustainably expanding cross-selling within the framework of the \"Growing with Europe\" program. Note: To enhance comparability, we have adjusted the previous year\\'s figures for the current income and expenses of the disposed companies norisbank, Bank von Ernst and Bankhaus BethmannMaffei as well as the effects from the contractual trust agreement (CTA) and the risk shelter for Hypo Real Estate.

       " \"Preliminary report on the 2nd quarter 2004 Hanover, 5 August 2004 TUI shows good business development in 2004 / Strong improvement in operating results. Upswing in tourism / At EUR 100 million second quarter earnings almost doubled / At least 70 percent increase in earnings for 2004 financial year expected. Growth in shipping continues / At EUR 79 million second quarter earnings well above previous year / Further positive development in the second half-year expected. Extraordinary good earnings in trading / Second quarter earnings improved to EUR 39 million. Strong increase of operating results by divisions in 2004 / More than EUR 420 million (previous year: EUR 242 million) expected. Earnings by divisions and Group turnover In the current 2004 financial year, TUI has substantially improved earnings from operations in its core business tourism, in the high-growth shipping division and in the trading activities. Adjusted for unusual expenses and income, earnings of the divisions was significantly higher year-on-year totalling EUR 112 million in the 2nd quarter of 2004 (previous year: EUR - 29 million). At EUR - 115 million in the 1st half of 2004 (previous year: EUR -317 million), the seasonal negative result was clearly improved. The turnover of the TUI Group was EUR 4.54 billion (previous year: EUR 5.04 billion) in the 2nd quarter of 2004. Turnover in the 1st half of 2004 reached EUR 8.05 billion (previous year: EUR 8.82 billion). Adjusted for the turnover of the activities divested both in the previous year and in the first half of 2004, Group turnover for the continued activities rose by 1.9% in the 2nd quarter and by 3.2% in the 1st half-year. Tourism Following the successful start to the new business year, the upswing in the tourism division continued in the 2nd quarter of 2004. Turnover generated by the tourism division in the 2nd quarter of 2004, improved by 2.1% to EUR 3.30 billion (previous year: EUR 3.23 billion). In the 1st half of 2004, the turnover was 3.3% higher year-on-year, totalling EUR 5.63 billion (previous year: EUR 5.46 billion). The Northern Europe Sector, in particular, recorded significant improvements. In the 2nd quarter of 2004, earnings of the tourism division increased to EUR 100 million (previous year: EUR 53 million), advancing by around 89%. The Central Europe and Northern Europe sectors made the most significant contribution to this. Business in the source markets Germany, United Kingdom and in the Nordic countries, in particular, enjoyed an improvement. Cumulatively, earnings of the tourism division in the 1st half of 2004 increased by 57.3%, achieving EUR - 85 million (previous year: EUR - 199 million). The principal success factors were conservative planning of flight and hotel capacities and optimisation of load factors and occupancy rates. Additional factors were good price quality, a significant reduction in last-minute marketing and the success of cost reduction measures. Logistics The logistics division closed the 2nd quarter of 2004 successfully. Container shipping above all continued its positive business development. Turnover of the division stood at EUR 864 million (previous year: EUR 953 million), due to the divestments in the special logistics sector. On a like-for- like basis, turnover in the logistics division increased by 10.9% - largely due to the growth in shipping. In the 1st half of 2004, turnover totalled EUR 1.77 billion (previous year: EUR 1.85 billion), with turnover of the remaining activities rising by 8.8%. Shipping maintained its growth in business volume. Turnover in the 2nd quarter of 2004 rose to EUR 672 million (previous year: EUR 577 million) and was 16.5% above the previous year figure. At 1.25 billion (previous year: EUR 1.11 billion), turnover of the 1st half of 2004 increased by 12.8%. The logistics division closed the 2nd quarter of 2004 with earnings of EUR 72 million (previous year: EUR 68 million). The major contribution was made by the shipping sector, which increased its earnings by 75.6% to EUR 79 million (previous year: EUR 45 million). As a consequence, earnings of the division for the 1st half of 2004 were likewise above the previous year, totalling EUR 106 million (EUR 103 million). The share of the shipping sector was EUR 104 million (previous year: EUR 64 million), representing an increase of 62.5%. Other sectors In the trading sector, the operations of the US steel service companies once again developed exceptionally good against the background of a favourable steel market. Turnover in the 2nd quarter of 2004 consequently rose by 61.9% to EUR 252 million (previous year: EUR 155 million). For the 1st half of 2004, the sector reported a turnover of EUR 451 million (previous year: EUR 317 million), an increase of 42.3%. At EUR 39 million (previous year: EUR 0 million), earnings in the 2nd quarter of 2004 were also substantially up on the previous year and has already reached EUR 64 million (previous year: EUR - 1 million) for the 1st half of 2004. The earnings development of central operations was primarily affected in the past by unusual expenses and income from divestments. Income from divestments in the 1st half of 2004 was very low compared to the previous year. Central operations consequently showed a result of EUR - 78 million in the 2nd quarter of 2004 (previous year: EUR 499 million). In the 1st half of 2004, earnings was EUR - 161 million (previous year: EUR 626 million), including unusual expenses and income of EUR 39 million (previous year: EUR 849 million). Outlook With business in the core divisions having already developed better than expected in the 1st half of 2004, the prospects for the 2004 business year as a whole are promising. In tourism, bookings for the current summer season are good. The booking figures in the important large source markets of Germany and the UK continued to rise, above all due to the strong demand of the past few weeks. As a consequence, the main holiday periods in the 3rd quarter as well as October are already very well booked. Noticeable outcomes of this are improvements in the flight load factor and hotel occupancy rate. In addition the upturn in the Nordic countries is having a favourable effect on the overall development of the division. Following the restructuring of the business, this sector is once again achieving positive results. All in all, in the 2nd half-year the tourism division can therefore continue the pleasing development already achieved in the previous year's period and thus generate a result for the 2004 financial year, which will be at least 70% better than last year. For shipping, the prospects after the previous growth figures are likewise good for the 2nd half-year. The economic situation and our strong competitive position are reasons to expect a further growth in transport volumes. With persistently high freight rates, the positive business development will go on, so that we anticipate that the 2004 business year will close with an increased result over the previous year. Against this background, we can assume that in the 2004 financial year earnings of the divisions, adjusted for unusual expenses and income, will be significantly higher than last year and reach at least EUR 420 million (previous year: EUR 242 million). end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 05.08.2004\",\n",
       " \"Nuremberg based LEONI Group's external sales posted in the first half of 2004 an increase of about nine percent to Euro 593.7 million as compared with the previous year's Euro 545.4 million. The successful start of production of the cable harness for the new Opel Astra was the principal contributory factor to this increase in sales. Further required advance spending on the construction of new facilities as well as cost cutting measures in the Wiring Systems division weighed on Group's earnings in the second quarter. With aggregate EBIT of Euro 17.5 million, the result falls about 42 percent below the previous year's 6- month EBIT of Euro 30.4 million, as expected. Consolidated net income amounted to Euro 8.2 million in the first half of 2004 (previous year: Euro 13.3 million). The number of LEONI employees rose to nearly 25,000 worldwide. Compared with the first quarter, the number increased by about nine percent in the second quarter of 2004. Scaling up production at the new facilities in Slovakia and Romania will give substantial growth impetus in the second half of the year. This is why LEONI expects its consolidated sales for fiscal 2004 to be at least ten percent above the figure of the previous year. Earnings can also be expected to recover substantially in the second half of 2004. The measures to restructure the Wire Division have almost been completed, and the Wiring Systems Division already absorbed, in the second quarter, most of the exceptional charges associated with cost cutting measures.

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) grew at a disproportionately high ratio to sales, rising 80.1% to Euro 2.3 million (prior year: Euro 1.3 million.). Similarly, consolidated earnings increased by 63.2% from the prior year period to Euro 932,000 (prior year: euro 571,000). Based on the key indicators and the development of business in the first half of 2004, paragon's Managing Board raised projected sales for the year as a whole and said, paragon is slowly but surely moving into new dimensions. The growth is visible and continuous, and above all has great potential. Therefore the Managing Board is very pleased to be able to significantly raise projected sales and is now expecting over 50% growth as well as a continued and disproportionately high increase in earnings. The Automotive business division increased its sales by 49.2% to Euro 18.1 million in the period under review (prior year: Euro 12.1 million). Its share in total sales was 62.0% (prior year: 62.7%). The climate control systems product area with the air quality sensors product line did especially well. Sales in the Electronic Solutions business division, which provides customized, integrated, and comprehensive solutions for industrial electronics, rose 60.3% from the prior year period to Euro 10.7 million in the period under review (prior year: Euro 6.7 million). This represents a Euro 36.7% share in total sales (prior year: 34.6%). The Electronic Solutions business division also includes the sales of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiary Miquest Corp. in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In the reporting period, its sales were at the same level as in the prior year at Euro 2.2 million due to exchange rate developments (prior year: Euro 2.3 million). On a U.S. dollar basis, Miquest achieved a 7% rise, while in comparison to the first quarter of 2004, the increase in the second quarter was as high as about 170%. This dramatic rise was, among other things, the result of a major contract that had already been anticipated the year before. In the Building Technology business division, paragon achieved sales of Euro 372,000 (prior year: Euro 512,000), representing a 1.3% share in total sales. The field test phase for the Gas Watch Dog(R) gas detection system is expected to be successfully completed in the second half of 2004. Analogous to this development, paragon expects to see a continuous rise in sales in this business division in the future. paragon's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) rose by 80.1% to Euro 2.3 million in the first six months of fiscal 2004 as compared to the same period of 2003 (prior year: Euro 1.3 million. This means that for the tenth successive quarter, paragon has increased its EBIT margin at a disproportionately high ratio to sales, this time to 7.8% (prior year: 6.5%). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) improved by 52.8% to Euro 4.3 million (prior year: Euro 2.8 million). paragon's consolidated earnings increased by 63.2% from the prior year period to Euro 932,000 (prior year: Euro 571,000). On the basis of 4,030,838 shares, net income for the period represents diluted and undiluted earnings per share of Euro 0.23 (prior year: Euro 0.14). During the first half of 2004, personnel capacity and structures were adapted to current developments: as at June 30, 2004, the paragon Group employed 282 persons (prior year: 224), of which 32 worked in the USA. At the end of the reporting period, the Company's cash and cash equivalents rose to a total of Euro 3.1 million (December 31, 2003: Euro 2.5 million) and shareholders' equity increased to Euro 13.2 million (December 31, 2003: Euro 12.1 million). In the first half of 2004, paragon invested the record sum of Euro 17.9 million in property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets. Important investments included the acquisition of the air quality sensor business of Robert Bosch GmbH, the expansion of corporate headquarters in Delbrück, the continued expansion of the facility in Suhl, investments in machinery, and the construction of the new sensor element factory paragon fidelio GmbH. The Managing Board considers that, halfway through fiscal year 2004, paragon is on the right track. paragon plans to financially and strategically secure the successful development in the long term and gain new markets. This is why paragon is currently broadening its technological basis in order to develop greater independence in the production of complete systems and consequently become a more comprehensive module and system manufacturer. According to the Managing Board, there are several elements that contribute significantly to paragon's very promising prospects for the future: the Company's own sensor element factory, paragon fidelio GmbH, and the successfully integrated Bosch air quality sensor business. The most important of all is the acquisition of the electromechanical specialist Andreas Haller Fabrik für Feinmechanik GmbH & Co. KG, located in St. Georgen, a town in Germany's Black Forest region. Therefore, the recently completed acquisition of this company, a well-known manufacturer of indicators for the automotive industry, will create completely new opportunities for the operating controls product area. Further acquisitions are conceivable\",\n",

The IT service provider anticipates an operating result of approx. EUR 500,000 for the first six months of 2004, as against about EUR -200,000 for the same prior year period. Both core segments of the company, IT training and IT consulting, contributed to this positive result. Half-yearly sales 2004 rose by 11% to a figure of approx. EUR 10 million. As a comparison, from January to June 2003, TRIA generated EUR 9 million in sales (plus additional EUR 1.7 million from unprofitable, discontinued areas). The corporation also noted positive cashflow for the first six months of the current fiscal year 2004. Traditionally, seasonal factors weaken results for the third quarter; however, compared to the same prior year period, developments are progressing more satisfactorily and are expected to render better results than Q3 2003. TRIA is generally within target for the year as a whole, and continues to aim for sales growth of 5-10% on a comparable basis and a sustained return to profitability. The planned growth will be primarily generated by the advanced development of TRIA .NET services in the consulting and on-demand training service segments.

       " 'DATA MODUL increases revenues by +39% and EBIT by +23,6% in the 1st half of 2004 Current stock price development caused Data Modul to accelerate publication from Aug.10th to Aug. 5th. Data Modul in Munich is active world wide in the manufacture and sale of flat panel displays, complete information systems, software and service. Contrary to the general economic trend, during the first six months of 2004, Data Modul was able to increase revenues by 39 % to 74 million euros, compared to 53.2 million euros during to the same period last year. At the same time, EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) increased by 23.6 % to 1.7 million euros. The product mix shifted during the first half of this year, and especially in the second quarter, strongly in the direction of multi-media, not the least because of the weak condition in the industrial area. In the second quarter of the current year, a revenue increase of 70.9 % to 42.3 million euros (24.8 million euros last year) was achieved. Order entry in the second quarter reached 37.2 million euros (34.9 million euros last year), or an increase of 6.5 %. EBIT according to US-GAAP improved in the second quarter 2004 to 0.7 million euros (0.2 million euros last year), or an increase of 202.2 %. A comparison of just the second quarters of each year shows a 75 % improvement in earnings per share to 0.07 per share (0.04 euro per share last year). Earnings per share in the first half of this year reached 0.23 euro per share (based on 3,194,400 issued shares), which is exactly the same value as in the previous year, and was caused by higher deferred tax expenses than last year. Capital expenditures during the period between January and June were at 0.9 million euros and exceeded the prior year by 46.2 %. Investment was focussed in the production area to adapt the manufacturing capacity to increased demand. The strong activity in order entry in the first half of the year, with an increase of 24.2 % to 78.5 million euros (63.2 million euros last year), and the resulting higher order backlog of 68.3 million euros (62.8 million euros last year), both as of June 30, 2004, were driven by larger projects in applications for airport information systems, as well as for the area of multi- media. The relatively high order backlog represents a theoretical revenue flow of about six months, as was the case in the previous year. As of June 30, 2004, the number of employees totalled 252, which is an increase of 21 compared to the same period last year. The increase in personnel was primarily in manufacturing in connection with increased utilisation. The successful transformation of Data Modul from a supplier of electronic components and subassemblies, to a manufacturer of complete information systems and high tech flat screen monitors has been confirmed through the already achieved strong market position. In order that the profit growth equals the sales development in the future, cost reduction programs in all areas to utilise the existent optimisation possibilities and process amelioration following the strong revenue growth will be implemented.

       " 'init revises prospects for 2004 after weak result in Q2 Burdened by a number of extraordinary trends toward the end of the second quarter, business at init innovation in traffic systems AG was hampered by customer-related and technical delays in major projects in the USA and in Europe. This lead to a loss of sales and an increase in production costs. In addition, the operating result was affected in particular by a further decline in sales exceeding 50 percent on the domestic market in Germany. This was met by init with a catalog of measures and the closure of its branch offices in both Berlin and Essen, resulting in a one time cost burden in the second quarter. While provisional figures for April through June revealed that the revenue of init, on the whole, clearly increased as compared to the first quarter of 2004, from 3.6 to 5.3 million Euro, the operating result (EBIT) turned out negative, falling to -2.3 million Euro (2003: +0.8 million Euro). For the first six months of 2004, this adds up to an EBIT of -4.5 million Euro (2003: -0.1 million Euro) and sales amounting to 8.9 million Euro (2003: 12.3 million Euro). After an almost balanced result in 2003, the group deficit totaled -3.0 million Euro, while the net earnings per share stood at -0.30 Euro (2003: 0.00 Euro). However, due to a forced reduction in accounts receivable and an increase in advances received from customers, init managed to attain a positive cash flow of 1.0 million Euro as of the end of June (2003: -2.0 million Euro). Due to increasing hardware deliveries for major projects in the USA and in Europe, init anticipates sales to rise by the end of the year. In view of the lasting weakness of the German market, however, we believe that, as matters stand, our original growth targets of 33 million Euro in sales and an operating result (EBIT) of 1 million Euro are quite unlikely. Having weighed all the factors burdening the company, init anticipates sales over 30 million Euro and an EBIT of -2 million Euro for the entire year. Based on the record level of orders of currently 46 million Euro and potential contracts totaling in excess of 120 million Euro, the medium- and long-term growth prospects of init continue to be sound.

The Group posted first-half sales of Euro 65.4 million in the January-June period this year compared to Euro 63.2 million in the same period in 2003. At constant exchange rates, sales rose 5% for the first half of the year, increasing to Euro 66.0 million. The rise in sales can be attributed to the overall improvement of the world economic context as well as to the strength of the JIL SANDER spring/summer collection.

Adjusted for exchange rate and structural effects, this is in fact an improvement of 4.6 percent. The prime growth drivers were the Aluminum Technology and Motor Service divisions. Earnings posted in H1/2004 reflect the Group's globalization efforts and the systematic focus on successful market trends.

Making the overall growth all the more compelling is the fact that, in the interest of a stronger positioning as a luxury brand (and unlike one year earlier), no appreciable volume of discounted sale items was shipped in the first quarter. At the Wolford-owned outlets, sales from the new stores exceeded sales lost by closures for the first time since 2002. As in the past quarters, the Wolford- owned locations were the strongest growth driver, with a sales increase of 7.3 percent. They now account for 27 percent of total sales. Even in a market like Germany that remains difficult for Wolford, the proprietary locations achieved sales growth of 18 percent compared to last year's first quarter. In the first quarter the total number of Wolford boutiques decreased from 226 to 223. While five partner boutiques and two Wolford-owned ones were closed, four new partner boutiques opened in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Kuwait. Growth in Wolford's brand sales was particularly gratifying in the core legwear business, at 17 percent.

Early lead customers will present their experiences at the SIS 2004 in Aachen on 26 and 27 October. 2004-Outlook: Break-Even amidst continued market reluctance With continued reluctance in the market yet an anticipated stable market share, Parsytec anticipates slightly lower order entry and revenue compared to 2003. Based on the increased efficiency, the goal to reach break-even continues to be realistic from the company's point of view. With the intensive investments in the further development and market introduction of parsytec 5i, the company aims to further strengthen its competitive position and attain clear growth again in 2005 and the following years.

       " \"technotrans back on Growth Track in Financial Year 2004 technotrans, leading systems supplier of equipment for the printing industry and the manufacture of micro technology, is able to look back on a highly satisfactory second quarter to 2004. Revenue growth continued to gain momentum. The factor behind the increase of 15.5 percent compared with the previous year to revenue of EUR 28.1 million (previous year: EUR 24.3 million) was the Print segment, which was up by almost EUR 3.5 million or 21.5 percent on the prior- year quarter alone. With consolidated revenue reaching EUR 54.8 million mid-way through 2004 (previous year EUR 50.1 million), the growth rate was 9.3 percent. The rise in revenue was reflected by a substantial improvement in earnings. Gross earnings at the six-month mark were up 15.4 percent to EUR 18.8 million (previous year EUR 16.2 million). In particular as a result of the DRUPA, which takes place only once every four years, distribution costs rose sharply in the first half (+ EUR 892,000 compared with previous year). In spite of this burden, the operating profit at the year's mid-point was up by 62.6 percent to EUR 4.7 million (previous year EUR 2.9 million). The rate of return for the segments at last returned to the excellent level of 9.4 percent (previous year 6.4 percent) in the second quarter. The net profit half way through the year is just under EUR 2.8 million (+ 180 percent), equivalent to earnings per share of EUR 0.42 (previous year EUR 991,000 or EUR 0.15 per share). At the year's midway point, cash flow had risen to EUR 7.8 million (previous year: EUR 5.2 million), representing growth of 50 percent. The free cash flow likewise touched a record level of more than EUR 7.0 million (previous year EUR 3.9 million). The rise in revenue since mid-2003 once again resulted in the recruitment of additional personnel. Whereas the group numbered only 577 employees on June 30, 2003, by June 30, 2004 the total had already risen to 606. This rise was due primarily to the extension of production capacity, particularly at the German sites.

Cumulative figures for the first six months of 2004 show that both sales and earnings are higher than the figures for the same period last year. Sales rose to EUR 479.4 million (2003: EUR 442.0 million), an improvement of 8.5 percent on 2003. Of this, the Business Segment Engineered Wood accounted for EUR 378.0 million, while the Business Segment Infrastructure Technology added a further EUR 101.3 million to Group sales. EBITDA exceeded last year's figure by 27.3 percent, reaching EUR 44.3 million for the first six months of 2004 (2003: EUR 34.8 million). EBIT has increased by 90.1 percent to EUR 27.0 million (2003: EUR 14.2 million). Earnings from discontinued activities for the first half of 2004 came to EUR 26.0 million. This was largely due to the sale of the operations of Newmark International, Inc. in the USA, as well as the wind tower production operations in Leipzig, both measures having been announced this spring. These transactions, together with current expenses for discontinued activities, resulted in an income of EUR 26.0 million. Net corporate indebtedness fell to EUR 198.2 million. The equity ratio increased from 17.9 percent (Dec. 31, 2003) to 22.9 percent as of June 30, 2004. Overall earnings before taxes (EBT) came to EUR 44.7 million (2003: EUR 0.4 million). The pre-tax margin of the continued operations improved to 3.9 percent. Earnings per share came to EUR 0.77 for the first half of 2004, compared to EUR -0.17 for the first half of 2003.

       " \"- Earnings before taxes up 50% - Share of online advertising market improves to 17.1% in June Munich, 10 August 2004 - TOMORROW FOCUS AG (WKN 549532), one of the leading digital media companies in Germany, recorded positive growth in both sales and earnings in the first half of the current financial year. In the recently concluded second quarter in particular, sales increased by 16% from EUR 11.4 million to EUR 13.2 million. As a result, sales for the first half of 2004 as a whole amounted to EUR 24.4 million as against EUR 23.5 million in the previous year, representing an increase of around 4%. Adjusted for the deconsolidation of the IMP agency, sales of EUR 22.0 million were generated in the same period of the previous year, corresponding to year-on-year growth of 10.9%. The positive business development at TOMORROW FOCUS AG is continuing apace despite the weakness of the advertising market. This serves to validate the company's chosen strategy of expanding its portal activities and focusing on its core business areas. The substantial enlargement of the health segment has been driven by extensive cooperation with market leaders, particularly in the pharmaceuticals industry. In conjunction with investments in new areas in the portal segment, earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of EUR 34,000.00 was generated for the first half of the year, compared with EUR -0.6 million in the previous year. Earnings before taxes (EBT) increased by around 50%, from EUR 1.2 million in the previous year to EUR -0.6 million in the first half of 2004. In the first six months of the current financial year, TOMORROW FOCUS AG's core portal segment recorded sales of EUR 15.0 million, up 15% on the contribution of EUR 13.1 million generated in the same period of the previous year. Earnings from portal activities improved significantly in the first half of the year: the operating result (EBITDA) increased to EUR 1.6 million (previous year: EUR 1.0 million). There was also notable growth in the EBITDA margin, which amounted to 11% in 2004 after 8% in the previous year. As in previous quarters, the contribution to earnings from the Playboy and Bellevue shareholdings developed extremely positively. Whereas sales increased by a moderate 7% in the first half of the year, margins and earnings grew substantially by comparison. In H1, TOMORROW FOCUS AG's investments generated a positive contribution to the operating result (EBITDA) of EUR 0.8 million (previous year: EUR -0.3 million), and contributed EUR 0.5 million (previous year: EUR 0.5 million) to earnings before taxes (EBT). TOMORROW FOCUS AG's technology segment recorded a fall in sales; this is because the sales generated by the IMP Interactive Marketing Partner GmbH agency, which has now been sold, were fully attributable to this segment. At the reporting date 30 June 2004, sales amounted to EUR 5.4 million as against EUR 7.5 million in the first half of 2003, while the segment reported negative earnings before taxes (EBT) of EUR 0.2 million (previous year: EUR -0.01 million). With the expansion of its marketing portfolio to include the portals for young people acquired from Axel Springer Verlag, TOMORROW FOCUS AG now has the largest media portfolio on the German-speaking Internet, with a total of 30 titles. An increased market share of 17.1% also gives the company an extremely strong platform for the fourth quarter, which traditionally sees high levels of sales.

The turnover of the first six months of 2004 was 17.6 mio EUR after 22.6 mio EUR in the same period 2003. The 22.2% decline is, among other reasons, due to the fact that the restructuring of the Company's marketing and sales organization - as was to be expected - did not yet contribute positively to turnover. Nevertheless, the first half of 2004 was characterized by a continuous line of positive announcements about new products and services, cooperations and distribution agreements, which, however, did not yet contribute to turnover. Due to this positive news flow and an increasingly well filled pipeline of international projects the Management Board of MWG Biotech AG maintains that the targets communicated for 2004 (moderate turnover growth, balanced EBITDA and balanced cash flow) can still be reached. To achieve this, however, it is important that there will be now major time lags in the conclusion and realization of also larger projects, which in turn would impact the turnover relevance of these projects until year end, and thus also negatively influence the other target values. Due to the lower turnover, and the lower margins resulting in part from it, and despite considerable reductions in the costs, the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, and depreciation) was minus 3.3 mio EUR on June 30, 2004, and thus below the EBITDA after the first six months in 2003 of minus 0.3 mio EUR. The net loss of minus 6.5 mio EUR was on the same level as after the first two quarters in 2003 (minus 6.4 mio EUR), the result in 2003 being impaired by negative currency influences. The consumption of liquid funds of 7.4 mio EUR in the first half of the year resulted mainly from the operative business (5.2 mio EUR) mainly due to the still unsatisfying turnover development, and from scheduled investments (2.2 mio EUR).

The resulting non recurring expenses and depreciations impacted the business figures of the Mosaic Group in the first six months of 2004. In view of the ongoing and difficult market and business environment in its core markets, Mosaic continued the Group's consequential strategic focus on business areas with high growth potential. In the first six months of the 2004 financial year, Mosaic generated group revenues of TEUR 4,161 after TEUR 6,563 in the comparable period of the previous year. Revenues were characterised by customers postponing scheduled telecommunications and mail logistics projects and the launch of the new business model in the E-Business Integration Solution division. EBITDA was -TEUR 1,254 (2003: TEUR 408); EBIT was -TEUR 7,027 after -TEUR 2,647 in the first six months of 2003. EBIT was impacted by the development of revenues and non-recurring goodwill depreciation in the context of restructuring Mosaic Geva GmbH. The extraordinary result (-TEUR 1,778) relates predominantly to expenses for the reconciliation of interests and the social plan for employees leaving Mosaic Geva GmbH and the expenditure for the spin-off described below. Connected with the alignment of the personnel structure, personnel costs in the first half of 2004 were down year-on-year, by TEUR 742 or 12.8 percent. In the first six months of 2004 the Mosaic Group posted a result of -TEUR 6,834 in comparison to -TEUR 1,763 in the first half of 2003. As at the balance sheet data of June 30, 2004, the Mosaic Group retained its high equity ratio (74.3 percent) with a sound level of cash and cash equivalents totalling EUR 5,088 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased slightly year- on-year, by 5.9 percent (2003: TEUR 4,805). The sustained restructuring of the Group subsidiary, Mosaic Geva GmbH, initiated at the beginning of the 2004 financial year, resulted in the transfer of the two core areas to new companies to the end of the second quarter 2004. The core business area GPayS is being continued by the new Group subsidiary Payment Factory GmbH & Co. KG.

The Jenoptik Group recorded increases in sales of 13.2% to 752.9m euros (1st half 2003: 665.3m euros). The Group EBIT came to minus 8.4m euros, a rise, however, of 4.8m euros from the previous first half (1st half 2003: -13.2m euros). This figure, moreover, included planned restructuring costs for the Clean Systems business division, of which 9.0m euros were social plan costs. Without these costs, the Jenoptik operative result for the first half would have returned to positive figures. In addition to restructuring costs, the Group result for the period was weighed down by 12.3m euros in interest expense (1st half 2003: 7.3m euros) due to the bond issued in autumn 2003, and a 2.4m-euro increase in tax burden from the previous year. The Group result for the period, at minus 19.3m euros, therefore reflected only a slight improvement from the first half of 2003 (-20.1m euros). The Jenoptik Group reported a positive cash flow from operating activities for the first half of 2004 of 5.9m euros (1st half 2003: minus 22.8m euros).

Consolidated net income increased by 45% from the pro-rata prior year figure of EUR 58 million to EUR 84 million, corresponding to earnings per share of EUR 0.62 (pro rata 2003: EUR 0.43). The key indicators of the income statement developed according to or slightly above plan. During the second quarter of 2004, Hypo Real Estate Group achieved consolidated net income before taxes of EUR 59 million, an increase of 51 % over the pro-rata figure for 2003 (EUR 39 million). The growth in earnings is attributable primarily to the segment Hypo Real Estate International. Compared to the pro-rata prior year figure of EUR 44 million, semi-annual net income before taxes in this segment more than doubled to EUR 94 million during the first six months of 2004. This positive result derives above all from the inclusion of the US real estate financing portfolio acquired at the end of 2003 and from the successful new business. New business accelerated considerably during the second quarter, rising to EUR 3.7 billion for the entire half-year period. The segment Wuerttembergische Hypothekenbank reports semi- annual net income before taxes of EUR 32 million compared to the pro-rata prior year figure of EUR 27 million. Despite the anticipated decline in operating revenues caused by downsizing of unprofitable or non-strategic portfolio components, the segment Hypo Real Estate Deutschland improved net income before taxes from the pro-rata prior year figure of minus EUR 6 million to minus EUR 1 million. During the first six months of 2004, this segment reduced its total lending volume by EUR 5.0 billion overall. The Board of Management has confirmed its projections for the entire year 2004 in full. Consolidated net income before taxes is to move in a corridor between EUR 205 million and EUR 225 million, corresponding to a return on equity after taxes between 3.5 and 4 %. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 11.08.2004',\n",

Outlook: The further development of the global economy will also influence the performance in the second half of the current fiscal year. The development of raw material prices and exchange rates will have a major impact on the earnings development of Phoenix AG. From today\\'s perspective, Phoenix anticipates a significant improvement of both turnover and earnings compared to the previous year, also in the second half. In fact, the extraordinary good figures of the first half could definitely not be expected in the second half due to seasonal effects. As already in the first six months of this year, a positive cash flow will be generated also in the second half.

However an improvement was noted in comparison to the very hesitant first quarter 2004. A clear revival was evident in the level of orders received. The increase in orders received amounted to 18% higher than the same quarter in the previous year. As a result of this, orders in hand increased in the half year comparison by around 20% to EUR 62.4 million, it is the highest half-year value in the group\\'s history. In the months April to June 2004 BÖWE SYSTEC achieved a group turnover down 13% to EUR 71.2 million compared with EUR 81.6 million in the previous year. The result before interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDA) was down 43% to EUR 5.0 million. The net result in the same period was EUR -1.7 million compared to EUR 2.5 million in the same quarter in the previous year. Significant reasons for this were the decline in the results caused by the level of sales, as well as the increased level of marketing activities with the company fair, and the trade fair \"Drupa\". In addition higher depreciation and amortisation of goodwill to the sum of EUR 1.4 million arose, together with integration costs associated with the expanded activities in the card personalisation area. Group turnover totalled in the first half year EUR 137.6 million compared with EUR 159.1 million in the previous year, which amounted to a decrease of 13.5%, of which 5% can be ascribed to currency conversion fluctuations. The EBITDA came to EUR 8.3 million compared to EUR 14.7 million. The result after tax fell from EUR 1.1 million to EUR -4.1 million. Orders received in the second quarter came to EUR 81.2 million and were thus 18% higher than in the previous year. Orders received in the first half year showed an increase of 7,5% to a new maximum level of EUR 159.9 million (+14% after adjustment for currency effects). A substantial increase in both sales and results is anticipated for the second half year.

The company's sales exceeded the previous year's values significantly, both during the second quarter and during the entire first half-year of 2004. During the first six months of 2004, consolidated sales of EUR 100.0 million were realised. During the same period of 2003, Group sales after adjustment for discontinued operations amounted to EUR 88.6 million. This constitutes organic sales growth of 12.8 percent. Sales during the second quarter of 2004 amounted to EUR 48.3 million compared with EUR 42.0 million in the second quarter of 2003. This corresponds to an organic growth in sales of 15.0 percent. Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased significantly from EUR -0.7 million in the first half-year of 2003 to EUR 1.3 million in the first half-year of 2004. For the second quarter of 2004, Group EBITDA was EUR 0.6 million compared to EUR -1.2 million during the previous year's second quarter. Group earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) also moved into the black. Although negative Group EBIT of EUR -1.8 million was reported in the first six months of 2003, positive Group EBIT of EUR 0.5 million was realised in the first-half year of 2004. Correspondingly, Group EBIT of EUR 0.2 million was reported for the second quarter of 2004, compared to negative Group EBIT of EUR -1.7 million during the second quarter of 2003. Furthermore a positive free cash flow of EUR 1.6 million was realised in the second quarter of 2004. The reason for the positive business developments is the gradual increase in our customers' willingness to invest, which the Executive Board expects will improve further in the second half of 2004.

The EBITDA rose during this first half of 2004 by 163.2 percent to 10.0 million euros from 3.8 million euros (H1/03). Group revenues increased significantly during the reporting period to 170.1 million from 55.9 million euros (H1/03), for an improvement of 204.3 percent.

The number of wireless subscribers in the first six months of 2004 totaled about 1.623 million - while there were only some 570,000 subscribers during the prior year's first half. This means that the Group has posted growth in mobile- communications subscribers of about 184.7 percent. The striking business achievements during the first half of 2004 are attributable primarily to the acquisition of VICTORVOX AG (November 2003) and a noteworthy upswing in sales output.

The leading global provider of systems for the diagnosis and treatment of eye ailments doubled its consolidated net income to EUR 9.4m (previous year: EUR 4.7m). Consequently, there was also a significant increase in earnings per share. The latter amounted to EUR 0.33 (previous year: EUR 0.18).

       " \"Munich, 12.08.2004. For the first time under the new name of AZEGO Aktiengesellschaft, (SDAX) (formerly: ACG Advanced Component Group AG), the results are announced for the first half of the fiscal year 2004, which ended on June 30, 2004. Development of the business For the period under report the company reports sales of EUR 57.3 million. The sales in the second quarter (EUR 30.7 million) were thus 15.9% higher than in the first quarter (EUR 26.5 million) of the current fiscal year. In the second quarter 2004 EBITDA was negative at EUR -1.6 million. In comparison with the first quarter 2004 (EUR -0.6 million) this was a result which did not meet the expectations of the Board, but which is attributable, however, to significant one time effects in the amount of EUR 835,000. One time effects occurred and had a negative impact on the result due to the profound restructuring measures in connection with the focussing on the core business and the related change of the name of the company into AZEGO AG as well as to consulting activities in connection with the tax office proceedings. The reorganisation of the Board of AZEGO Aktiengesellschaft also resulted in one time effects. Dr. Reinhard Proske thus left the company at the end of June, 2004. Sven Janssen will also terminate his activity after the expiry of his contract. Thereafter, Norbert Wilkat, the Division Head for many years of AZEGO Technology Services will join the Board as COO and manage the operating activities. The Board of AZEGO is satisfied with the development of the gross profit margin. In the second quarter 2004 this amounted to 13.3% and thus remained stable at a satisfactory level in comparison with the first quarter (13.8%). The gross profit margin during the first half year 2004 amounted to 13.5% and was thus in excess of the company's expectations for this period. The gross profit margin from the comparative period of the first half year 2003 (10.4%) could also be exceeded substantially. This speaks for a positive overall development of the gross profit margin, which should be able to be maintained at a sustainable stable level in the future. The discontinued operations, representing a charge of EUR -1.6 million, still constituted a negative impact during the second quarter. Taking the discontinued operations into account, the net result for the second quarter 2004 amounted to EUR -3.6 million. The Board expects that the discontinued operations will be substantially reduced in the third quarter, following the complete conclusion of the divestment of Logos Smart Card A/S and Bluefish Technologies AG as at July 15, 2004. The further overall result for 2004 will thus probably be impacted to a significantly lesser extent. As at June 30, 2004 the equity ratio of the AZEGO Group amounted to 57.1%, representing only a minimal decline of 3.8% in comparison with March 31, 2004 (60.9%). The number of employees as at June 30, 2004 amounted to 218. The target of reducing the number of employees at the AZEGO holding company from 40 to 10 was almost completely achieved. An increase in the number of employees is expected for the whole AZEGO Group during the course of this fiscal year, above all in sales. Outlook 2004 In spite of a good level of orders on hand, positive perspectives and a successful restructuring of the AZEGO Group, the Board believes that the planned sales target will not be achieved. Nevertheless, there is a level of moderate optimism with regard to the current fiscal year\",\n",

       " 'STADA H1 2004: continued sales growth - weaker earnings mainly due to GMG In the first half of 2004, STADAs Group sales rose by +11% to EUR 396.6 million compared to the same period of the previous year. Net income decreased by -14% to EUR 20.0 million compared to the first half of the previous year. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to EUR 52.4 million (-19% compared to H1 2003), earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted to EUR 36.2 million (-24% compared to H1 2003), while earnings before taxes (EBT) amounted to EUR 31.1 million (-23% compared to H1 2003). Earnings per share (EPS) for the first half of 2004 were EUR 0.75 (H1 2003: EUR 1.16; with an increase in the average number of shares of approx. +33%); diluted EPS (according to IAS 33.24) amounted to EUR 0.75 (H1 2003: EUR 1.07). These figures include both positive and negative one-time special effects which, on balance, improved STADAs EBT for the first six months of 2004 by EUR 2.4 million. STADAs sales and, especially, earnings in the first half of 2004 were severely influenced by the effects of healthcare policy regulations. The greatest charges by far were imposed by the mandatory discounts that STADA has had to grant in Germany since the law on modernizing the German public healthcare system (GKV- Modernisierungsgesetz or GMG) came into effect on January 1, 2004. These mandatory discounts amounted to EUR 9.9 million for STADA in the first half of 2004 (H1 2003: EUR 3.1 million), thus accounting for approx. 32% of the Groups EBT reported for this period. From todays perspective, the Executive Board continues to believe that, despite current burdens, the intended double-digit percentage sales growth for the whole of 2004 is possible, although not certain. STADAs Group sales have continued to grow in the third quarter of 2004, so that after seven months they increased by approx. +10%. Notwithstanding the adverse effects outlined above, STADAs target for 2004 is for net income to be in the range of last years level. In order to attain this target, STADA has initiated cost-cutting programs in its Production and Sales & Marketing activities which, taken together, account for over 80% of the costs incurred by the Group. In the current third quarter of 2004, STADA has reduced the extraordinarily high discounts granted in the first half of the year in its direct business to German pharmacies, after competitors had already taken similar steps. It is currently unclear whether STADA can expect a reduction in charges in the German market due to the replacement of mandatory discounts with reference prices in 2005. If - as intended by the GMG - moderate new reference prices are introduced that include initial supplier products with similar active ingredients still covered by patents, STADA sees opportunities for significantly reducing its charges. In that case, mandatory discounts will have been simultaneously abolished and prices of the relevant products may only have to be lowered slightly, if at all. However, the current discussion on German healthcare policy is once again questioning this kind of reference pricing. If reference prices excluding patent-protected active ingredients were established, STADA may suffer because it would then have to substantially lower its prices - although this adverse effect may be partially or even fully offset by the simultaneous abolition of mandatory discounts. If, for the time being, reference prices were not established at all, STADAs charges would be significantly reduced. This is because on January 1, 2005, according to the GMG, the basis on which mandatory discounts are assessed will be reduced from the current 16% to only 6% of the ex-factory price of products containing active ingredients without reference prices. The Executive Board expects that the measures introduced will also have a positive impact on sales and earnings in 2005. In addition, the Group-wide flow of new product launches (total of 169 in H1 2004) continues to stimulate growth. In the opinion of the Executive Board, if the current healthcare policy framework proves to be stable in STADAs key national markets, especially in Germany, and the markets return to a policy of rational conditions in terms of pricing and discounts, STADA will be able to successfully continue its profit- oriented growth course in 2005 with renewed growth in sales and earnings.

       " 'MAN Group: Continued strong growth in business volume and earnings Interim Report as of 30 June 2004 The MAN Group registered a strong improvement in earnings during the first six months of 2004. Earnings before interest and taxes rose by EUR104 million to EUR220 million and earnings before taxes by EUR111 million to EUR143 million. Earnings per share rose by EUR0.50, from EUR0.14 to EUR0.64. During the second quarter of 2004, earnings before interest and taxes increased by EUR39 million to EUR143 million and earnings before taxes by EUR43 million to EUR106 million. Earnings per share improved by 71% to EUR0.48 (EUR0.28). Rising earnings improved the cash flow from operating activities to EUR235 million (EUR65 million) during the first six months. Compared with 30 June 2003 net debt could be reduced by EUR802 million to EUR394 million. Order intake rose by 20% during the first six months to EUR7.9 billion and by 18% in the second quarter to EUR4.2 billion. Particularly strong growth was registered by Commercial Vehicles and Diesel Engines. Printing Machines, Turbomachines and Industrial Services also recorded double-digit growth rates. Sales increased by 13% during the first half of the year climbing to EUR6.8 billion, and by 18% in the second quarter to reach EUR3.8 billion. Based on economic forecasts and the positive business trend during the first six months, our overall expectations for the 2004 financial year remain high, especially since business volumes continued to grow strongly in July 2004. Order intake is expected to show an increase of more than 10% compared with 2003 (EUR13.7 billion) and sales a slightly lower percentage rise (2003: EUR13.5 billion). We are confident of reaching pre-tax earnings of at least EUR400 million, which would represent an increase of more than 50% compared with 2003 (EUR261 million). The return on capital employed will rise in the Industrial Business sector (excluding Financial Services) from 8.9% in 2003 to around 12.5%, bringing us a large step closer to achieving our target of a 15% return on capital in the Industrial Business sector.

HY The half-year result of FJH AG (ISIN DE0005130108), the consultancy and software company listed in the TecDAX index, was severely affected by the unforeseen persistent reluctance of the insurance sector to invest. Revenues amounted to 35.6 million Euro (2003: 60.2 million Euro), half-year result after tax was -7.7 million Euro (2003: 7.7 million Euro) and EBIT -11.6 million Euro (2003: 12.6 million Euro). Other than expected and forecast by observers of the industry the cost cutting measures taken by the insurance companies and the continuing uncertainty with regard to the political framework have led to a significant reluctance to invest in IT. For the second half-year FJH notices a moderate improvement of capacity utilisation compared to the second quarter. This, however, will range below the plan estimate. In response to the changed market situation a comprehensive package of measures was initiated to reduce personnel expenses. This includes a significant reduction of employee capacities.

       " 'BÖWE SYSTEC to acquire majority in North America Group turnover set to exceed EUR 500 million in 2005 On 11 August 2004 BÖWE SYSTEC AG reached an agreement with its North American co-partners at BÖWE Bell & Howell, USA, with which the company has had a joint 50% holding up till now, according to which BÖWE SYSTEC can increase its share of BÖWE Bell & Howell to 60 % at the beginning of 2005. The remaining shares held by the outside shareholders are to be acquired in annual tranches of 10%. With this agreement BÖWE SYSTEC AG will fully consolidate its US-American activities from 2005 and as a result will be able to increase its turnover worldwide to more than EUR 500 million. The previous agreements with the co- partners made provision for BÖWE SYSTEC to be able to buy out the co-partners by means of option agreements in 3 annual stages from 2007. The Board of BÖWE SYSTEC AG sees the amended agreements as clearly enabling easier integration of the US company into the BÖWE SYSTEC Group, as well as extending those investments which are altogether linked with the acquisition of the majority over a five-year period instead of the previously agreed three-year period. By bringing the further takeovers forward, BÖWE SYSTEC expects a further increase in its result and overall a reduction in the total investment for the complete integration. At the same time within the framework of a restructuring of the finances of the American associated company the non-voting preference shares held by BÖWE SYSTEC have been redeemed by BÖWE Bell & Howell and with the proceeds the remaining liabilities from the initial acquisition of a 50% share in BÖWE Bell & Howell have been settled with the vendor.

The FLUXX Group posted revenues of EUR 8.2 million in the first half of 2004, equivalent to 40 percent growth. Earnings have been boosted by a disproportionately much higher rate, underlining the high scalability of the FLUXX Group's business model. EBITDA grew by 275 percent, from EUR 130 thousand in the first half of 2003 to EUR 488 thousand in the first half of 2004. EBIT moved EUR 80 thousand into the black for the first time; for the corresponding period of the previous year it was EUR -462 thousand. The consolidated first- half earnings were likewise positive for the first time, at EUR 99 thousand, contrasting with the loss of EUR 196 thousand for the corresponding prior-year period. The cash flow, which remained positive, and a capital increase for cash in April 2004 resulted in a significant improvement in the liquidity position. Compared with the position at June 30, 2003, cash and cash equivalents doubled from EUR 2.4 million to EUR 4.9 million on June 30, 2004. FLUXX held net cash totalling EUR 3.6 million at the first-half reporting date. The long-term liabilities of EUR 8.7 million at the reporting date were on a par with the figure in the 2003 Annual Report and stem principally from the loans from the Schleswig-Holstein Investment Bank and the shareholder NIB.

Munich, August 12, 2004. In the second quarter of 2004, the TecDAX- listed company Kontron AG posted strong rates of increase in both revenues and profits compared with the same period last year. In view of these developments, the Board of Directors is sharply increasing its earnings and sales forecasts for 2004 as a whole, and envisages doubling the company's EBIT from the EUR 10.2 million that was posted in 2003 to EUR 20 million. At the beginning of the year an increase of 70 percent had been anticipated. The forecast for organic growth in 2004 has been readjusted from 16 percent to 20 percent. The Board of Directors justifies its optimistic forecast by referring to the fact that the indicators are all pointing to a continuation of the growth impetus from the first half of the year into the coming months. In the second quarter of 2004, Kontron increased its sales over the same period last year from EUR 54 million to EUR 67.6 million - a leap of 25.2 percent. As a result, sales in the first half of 2004 advanced by 20 percent, from EUR 109.2 million in the first half of 2003 to EUR 130.7 million. Organic sales growth, adjusted for exchange rate effects, thus came to 28 percent compared with the first half of 2003. Orders on hand climbed to EUR 108 million by the end of the second quarter, their third successive record. In the first half of 2003 they had totaled EUR 94 million. The strongest growth momentum emanated from North America. EBIT amounted to EUR 6.1 million in the second quarter and EUR 10.6 million in the first half of the year. In the same periods last year, by way of comparison, EBIT before special depreciations had totaled EUR 2.1 million and EUR 3.6 million respectively. Net income for the period came to EUR 6.7 million in the first half of the year, with the second quarter contributing EUR 3.9 million. Operating cash flow from current business operations amounted to EUR 10.1 million in the second quarter (second quarter 2003: EUR 2.7 million).

Epigenomics AG (Frankfurt, Prime Standard: ECX), a molecular diagnostics company developing tests based on DNA methylation, announced today that it has met a key milestone in its breast cancer screening product development program. Based on studies conducted using breast cancer tissue samples, the Company has successfully identified several DNA methylation markers (biomarkers) that can potentially enable the early detection of breast cancer. Biomarkers are substances found in blood or tissues that indicate the presence of disease. In this case, specific DNA methylation biomarkers allow detection of breast cancer using Epigenomics' proprietary technologies. Achieving this milestone triggered a payment to Epigenomics from its development and commercialisation partner, Roche Diagnostics. Epigenomics will work to incorporate these DNA methylation markers into PCR assays (tests) and initiate a study of a large number of clinical serum samples, taken from breast cancer patients, over the next several quarters. The breast cancer tests being developed will attempt to measure these biomarkers in blood serum to differentiate between breast cancer and benign or normal breast conditions. Epigenomics believes that achieving this milestone on schedule demonstrates its ability to consistently meet commercially relevant product development milestones. To date, Epigenomics has successfully met every milestone in our collaboration with Roche, including the identification of DNA methylation markers for early detection products for colon and prostate cancers as well as for a product to predict the probability of relapse in women treated with the standard breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen\",\n",

Although this represents a decline of EUR 36.9 from the previous year, it must be noted that the first half year of 2003 saw four theatrical releases while this year's first half had one. The depreciation of film development costs, which do not have an impact on liquidity though, negatively impact this year's outlook and amounted to EUR 9.2 million. This represents an improvement of EUR 1.3 million compared to the same period last year. Actual film development spending though, which does have an impact on liquidity, amounted to only EUR 4.2 million in the first six months. Overhead costs show a positive development. Amounting to nearly EUR 6.5 million in this year's first half, this represents a further reduction of about 31% compared to the same period last year. Overall the first six months show a negative operating result (EBIT) of EUR -13.3 million, which is a decline of EUR 4.0 million compared to last half year's result of EUR -9.3 million. The group's equity ratio improved to 19.7 percent from 16.9 percent at the end of 2003. Bank liabilities were reduced by EUR 73.4 million. Thanks to continued cost reduction efforts the company generated a positive free cash flow for the first six months of this year. After also taking into account the positive effect of the April closing of the bridge loan, which was primarily used for debt reduction, liquidity was at EURO 1.2 million at the end of the second quarter. The bridge facility was refinanced in July with a $30 million term loan.

Net income for the first six months totaled EUR 16.5m, up from EUR. 6.2m for H1 2003. Calculated in line with the DVFA method, this translates into EPS of EUR 1.69 (prior year: EUR 0.59). This positive trend is attributable to higher sales which rose 6% from EUR 400,6m to EUR 424,5m and to the \"Grammer Offensive 2004+\", a program initiated during the second half of 2003 aimed at cutting costs and increasing efficiency throughout the Group.

According to figures published today, despite a fall in sales revenues to EUR 77.96 m (2003: EUR 110.51 m), during the second quarter of 2004 SDAX listed GERICOM AG achieved a positive operating result (EBIT) of EUR 0.63 m (2003: loss of EUR 0.70 m). The successful marketing of new products in the emerging business division Home Entertainment was instrumental for the attained turnaround. With round about EUR 26 m it already contributed some 33% to overall revenues. A predominant catalyst for growth in this area was the clear rise in demand for digital consumer electronics in the run-up of the European Football Championships as well as the Olympic Summer Games 2004. Thus also the order backlog could increase to 34.75 m EUR compared to previous year (30.06.2004: 31.74 m EUR). Beyond inventory levels could be further reduced to 46.07 m EUR in contrast to 94.73 m EUR by the end of 2003. Shareholders' equity rose to 59.39 m EUR with the equity ratio thus rising to more than 51% by the end of June. Decisive for the continuation of the positive trend of the first two quarters is the question as to weather or not the pessimistic mood of consumers throughout Europe and especially in the core market Germany can be overcome in the further course of the year. This factor will shape the operational development of GERICOM in the second half of the year. A persistent weakness in consumer spending can challenge the achievement of the 400 m EUR target in revenues.

At EUR 0.2 million, EBIT was above par in the first half, compared with a loss of EUR 0.2 million before interest and taxes in the same period a year ago. The company also improved its result after taxes, having reduced its loss to EUR 0.1 million (HY 2003: loss of EUR 0.5 million after taxes). Thus, UNITEDLABELS AG was able to emulate its performance of the first quarter. This is also reflected in substantially higher cash flow from operating activities, which rose markedly year on year from EUR 0.8 million to EUR 2.4 million.

       " 'Zeus opens up new income potential for SURTECO AG The restructuring programme that has now been concluded is already beginning to take effect Sales and earnings projected to rise in 2004 Buttenwiesen-Pfaffenhofen. - SURTECO AG launched the Zeus restructuring programme in January 2003 and implementation of new IT systems for sales and order planning completed this programme on time at the end of June 2004. The Group is one of the leading global players manufacturing edging strips based on paper and plastics, and decorative surface foils. The Zeus Programme made far- reaching changes in the Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Paper. A uniform administrative and sales concept was introduced for companies in the business unit and their manufacturing processes were optimized along global guidelines. The wide-ranging restructuring programme was completed at the beginning of July when Bausch GmbH, its British subsidiary Armabord Ltd and Robert Linnemann GmbH + Co were merged to form the single legal entity BauschLinnemann GmbH + Co KG based in Sassenberg/Westphalia. Concentrating the value-added stages and sites will place SURTECO AG in a position to achieve greater synergies. This benefit is being accompanied by improvements in the consistency of quality and increased security for supply. On the basis of the overall potential created by \"Zeus\", the Group is already anticipating an additional annual income potential of 10 million euros from 2005. The good news is that \"Zeus\" is already beginning to deliver benefits this year. Sales for the first half year went up by 7 % to 193.1 million euros and EBITDA rose by 12 % to 38.1 million euros by comparison with the equivalent period for the previous year. After six months, EBIT at 24.6 million euros is 19 % above the figures for 2003. Sales at the SBU Paper rose significantly during the second quarter of 2004 by 19 % to 49.9 million euros compared to the year-earlier period. The increase in sales for the first half of 2004 (98.8 million euros) was still 12 %. SURTECO AG has concentrated the activities of the companies making up the Döllken Group in the SBU Plastics and this business unit succeeded in raising its sales by 5 % during the second quarter. Sales at 94.3 million euros for the first six months were 3 % up on the equivalent year-earlier figure. SURTECO AG is highly geared towards export markets - the proportion of foreign sales amounts to 60 % - and this means that unfavourable currency relations impact negatively on earnings. As a result, unfavourable exchange-rate effects \"cost\" the Group about 2.5 million euros during the first half-year of 2004, even though foreign sales rose by around 10 %. Overall, SURTECO AG also registered a sustained slight upswing in business during the second quarter, although performance in Germany (+ 2 %) lags significantly behind performance abroad. As far as orders are concerned in the German construction and furnishing industry, the situation continues to remain unsatisfactory. Even if foreign markets do not develop as dynamically as during the first six months, SURTECO AG is embarking on the second half of the year with optimism. The Group is therefore forecasting an increase in sales of 3 % to around 365 million euros (2003: 355 million euros) for the fiscal year 2004, as well as an improvement in earnings compared with the previous year. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 13.08.2004',\n",
       " 'Constantin Film exceeds targets Positive EBIT of EUR 5.2 million generated by Constantin Film in the first half of 2004 alone 175% increase in sales over the previous year to EUR 99.0 million Forecast for the 2004 fiscal year raised München, August 13, 2004 Constantin Film AG (ISIN DE0005800809) achieved sales of EUR 99.0 million up to June 30, 2004 (1st half of 2003: EUR 36.0 million). The 175% increase in sales over the previous year is attributable not only to the success of the distribution and licence trading business in the current year but also and in particular to the consolidation in full of the interest in Constantin Entertainment GmbH that was acquired in September 2003, which contributed sales of EUR 37.1 million to the total performance of the Constantin Group in the first half of the year. The international sales were EUR 8.7 million higher than in the same period the previous year too. Sales in the second quarter amounted to EUR 38.4 million (2nd quarter of 2003: EUR 12.1 million). The Constantin Group generated EBIT of EUR 5.2 million in the first half of the year. This corresponds to 5.3 percent of sales. The EBIT recorded in the second quarter amounted to EUR 1.9 million. Fred Kogel, Chief Executive Officer of Constantin Film AG: \"The results achieved in the second quarter show that the approach adopted by the Management Board to expand the TV and home entertainment operations and to continue increasing the successful production, distribution and licence trading business as well as the intensive efforts to cut costs are taking effect, thus confirming the overall strategy initiated by the Management Board a year ago\". The balance sheet total was EUR 283.5 million on June 30, 2004 (December 31, 2003: EUR 315.9 million). This reduction is attributable essentially to the decrease in film assets due to the realisation of sales. The equity ratio is 24 percent. If the cash and cash equivalents are balanced with the bank loans and overdrafts and the film assets are balanced with the advance payments received, the adjusted equity ratio is 47 percent. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 64.8 million on June 30, 2004 (December 31, 2003: EUR 71.4 million), whereas bank loans and overdrafts were EUR 88.0 million (December 31, 2003: EUR 87.2 million). Net liquidity was EUR 7.5 million lower than on December 31, 2003. This change is attributable essentially to further investments made in our in-house productions. For the 2004 fiscal year as a whole, Constantin Film AQ has so far been planning an increase in sales over 2003 to at least EUR 180 million and have been communicating a target of positive EBIT amounting to at least EUR 6 million. In view of the successful integration of the new business operations - TV entertainment and in-house exploitation in the home entertainment field - and on the basis of the good development of the business in the first half of 2004, the board of Constantin Film is now raising this forecast and is planning an increase of more than 70 percent in sales over 2003 to at least EUR 200 million. The board is working on the assumption that positive EBIT of at least EUR 8 million will be generated for the year. The complete report on the 2nd quarter of 2004 will be available to be downloaded from our Web site http://www.constantinfilm.de and http://www.deutsche-boerse.com from August 13, 2004 onwards.

Earnings before taxes in the second quarter of 2004 amounted to EUR 4.0 million (previous year: EUR 2.7 million) and thus continued the positive development of the first three months (EUR 4.3 million; previous year: EUR minus 14.5 million). Earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose in the first half of 2004 to EUR 32.9 million (previous year: EUR 16.5 million). Along with a reduction of net financial debt to EUR 227.2 million as of June 30, 2004 (previous year: EUR 247.2 million), net financial expense improved by EUR 1.6 million to EUR 9.5 million. On consolidated net income of EUR 4.6 million (previous year: loss of EUR 6.7 million), earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.32 (previous year: EUR minus 0.47). The improved earnings situation is primarily attributable to the SPRINT SQUARED earnings enhancement program. Consolidated sales rose in the first half of 2004 to EUR 1,000.9 million (previous year: EUR 920.7 million). Consolidated incoming orders stood at EUR 975.0 million. As expected, they thus fell short of the unusually high previous- year level (EUR 1,513.0 million), which includes a large paint systems order from General Motors. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, sales would have come to EUR 1,037.6 million, and incoming orders to EUR 999.4 million. After last year's loss due to special influences, the Board of Management expects that earnings before taxes in 2004 will exceed the amount (EUR 18.7 million) achieved in 2003 before restructuring expense. Sales will probably be slightly lower than the previous year's high level. The financial statements for the first half of 2004 were prepared according to US GAAP. During an internal review, Dürr ascertained an overvaluation of order- specific receivables and undervaluation of accruals in the financial statements for the first quarter of 2003. The relevant items in the statements of income, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows for the first half of 2003 were subsequently adjusted. The adjustment does not affect the Group's annual financial statements of December 31, 2003, since the earnings effects in question were reversed in subsequent quarters\",\n",

Asslar, 13.08.2004: In the second quarter of 2004, PVA TePla AG succeeded in significantly expanding its volume of business. Incoming orders and the order backlog rose by around 20% in a year-on-year comparison and by around 25% compared to the first quarter of 2004. Sales revenues were also increased by 37% relative to Q1/2004. Business expansion was achieved across all divisions of the company. In the second quarter of 2004, the gross profit increased to 33% of sales, marking a significant improvement on the same period of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. This effect, and the results of the cost reduction measures that have now been largely completed, were major factors contributing to a substantial improvement in profits. An operating profit (EBIT) of EUR 0.4 million and a net income of EUR 0.2 million were achieved in the second quarter of 2004. This means that, for the first time since the merger in November 2002, PVA TePla AG has now returned to the profit zone. Profits were also improved substantially in a year-on-year comparison of half-year figures. The EBIT figure for the first half of the year came in at EUR -1.2 million (HY1/2003: EUR -2.9 million), and the net income for the period at EUR -0.7 million (HY1/2003: EUR -1.1 million, including special effects). Cash flow from operating activities, at EUR 1.2 million (HY1/2003: EUR -3.1 million), was positive in the first six months of the year. Development of innovative products was pursued in a concentrated manner, and the product portfolio of the Crystal Growing Systems division was strategically broadened. With this as a basis, and with optimised cost structures, a substantial upswing in incoming orders and better forecasts for the relevant markets from leading economics institutes, the Board of Management is able to confirm its previous forecasts and expects a positive operating result for the second half of 2004',\n",

In the third quarter of the fiscal year 2003/2004 net AG showed an almost even result and remains profitable over all. The company showed this strength despite a very differentiated reporting about its discussions with German music publishers in the business division Communication Technology. Per 30.06.2004 the company shows a result of EUR 892,000 EBITDA. Compared to the corresponding figure for the same period of the previous year of EUR -2,530,000 EBITDA thus improved by EUR 3,422,000. These figures were obtained through satisfactory results in all business divisions. Especially the division Information Technology showed an EBITDA of EUR 1,507,000 and was within the expectations. The business division Communication Technology showed an EBITDA of EUR -132,000. The expectation of the management fearing by far larger strains on the profits of the company due to the negotiations with the music publishers were smaller than expected.

The Group's operating profit (EBIT before onetime effects) increased considerably, from EUR -3,2 million to EUR 3,4 million. In the core business segment of Imaging (selling and servicing printers, copiers, fax machines and archiving systems) sales grew from EUR 152.8 million in the previous year to EUR 156.7 million in the reporting period, while increasing the EBIT by almost 45% from EUR 7.7 million to EUR 11.1 million and gaining additional market share. Overall, the restructuring of the Presentation and Media Technology business segment is proceeding as planned, though the successes achieved in the meantime are not yet finding reflection to their full extent in the corresponding half- year figures. Year-on-year, this segment's sales dropped to EUR 37.3 million (previous year's period: EUR 47.2 million). The same applies to earnings: The EBIT (before one-time charges) of the previous year's period amounted to EUR - 0.5 million compared to EUR -1.5 million in the reporting period. The Central Division burdened the EBIT (before one-time charges) for the first six months of 2004 by EUR -6.2 million (previous year: EUR -7.4 million), with pension costs of EUR 3.7 million accounting for a major portion of this figure. The number of employees in the Central Division has been halved within a year. The relocation of the main Munich site to the company's headquarters in Nuremburg has been completed. The previous year's financial statements to June 30 included onetime income of EUR 7.2 million arising from the sale and divestment of the remaining non-core activities, which was completely absent from the period under review. In contrast, extraordinary expenses of EUR 3.3 million were incurred in the first six months of 2004 relating to the reorganization of the Triumph-Adler Group.

The former clinic will be completely renovated and divided into 41 apartments which will be sold under leasehold terms. The property itself will remain with VIVACON AG. Planning for the apartments is already under way. The total sales volume is estimated to reach c. EUR 12m. Marketing of these apartments is scheduled to begin in October 2004. Beginning of this year VIVACON AG had already acquired another former hospital from Vivantes GmbH and begun marketing it in February 2004 and has meanwhile sold c. 80% of these apartments. The management of VIVACON AG estimates that due to the excellent location and the exceptional value for money, most apartments should be sold by year-end 2004.

In the first half of 2004, Vivacon boosted revenues to EUR 20.9 mn, compared to EUR 10.9 mn in H1 2003. This constitutes an increase of 92%. EBIT amounted to EUR -0.7 mn as per 06/30/2004 (previous year: EUR 1.4 mn). Net income came in at EUR -1.3 mn, as opposed to EUR 0.1 mn earned in the prior-year period. EBIT and net income were mainly affected by pre-construction marketing costs incurred due to the strong upswing in business, including such projects as 'Villa St. Gertraudt' and 'Lebensparadies Arkadien' in Wesel. In keeping with our buy-and-sell strategy, Vivacon's sales activities in the first half-year focused on marketing the remaining apartments of the residential projects already on the market so that, once these properties were completely sold out, we would take on new projects. This explains why there were no contributions to income as per IAS 40 during the first half of 2004. The contract backlog went up slightly year-on-year, to EUR 21.0 mn, from EUR 20.9 mn in 2003. During the first half-year, the backlog rose to an all-time high of EUR 27.6 mn before coming down in the course of the half-year.

Consolidated net income was Euro 2.1 million (p.y.: Euro 2.3 million). Earnings per share were Euro 0.59 (p.y.: Euro 0.65). The drop in the earning figures results mainly from the ongoing price competition. The current expansion of plant facilities in Thailand and Romania, and the transition of production away from locations with higher production costs which has been made possible by this expansion, will, together with cost reductions for primary products, help to maintain our position in the market, a market which remains subject to intense price competition. It will only be possible to increase the operating result by increasing sales. We expect our efforts to yield positive results in this regard from the fourth quarter onwards, particularly in the USA. As things look today we expect a weaker development in the third quarter compared with last year. For the fourth quarter we expect our greatly increased sales efforts to produce a positive effect, in particular in the USA. Based on these considerations, we are keeping to the budget figures we have already published, but are orientating ourselves towards the lower end of the range named; this would correspond to consolidated sales of Euro 130.0 million and consolidated net income of Euro 3.5 million for the whole of 2004.

The Frankfurt-based company achieved sales of more than EUR 6.0 million for the second quarter of 2004. Thus Neue Sentimental Film AG has been able to outmatch its forecast for the mid-year with sales of more than EUR 12 million slightly. In spite of a still dissatisfying business environment sales could be increased about 6 percent compared to the adjusted amounts of the previous year. As a consequence of the cost-cutting and reorganization measures initiated in 2003 and ended in the first quarter of 2004, NSF was able to reach a positive EBITDA - sooner than expected - in the second quarter of 2004. As the first half of the fiscal year is significantly weaker than the second half due to the seasonal nature of advertising film production, these figures already show that in 2004 the group will once again be able to realize a balanced result - in particular, as already announced, on an EBITDA and also probably on an EBIT-basis.

CTS Eventim AG, leading enterprise in the sale of tickets for concerts, theatre performances and sports events as well as promoter of live entertainment, developed its business superbly in the first half-year.

The expected decline in turnover of roughly 11 percent is a result of a fewer number of big events with international top stars. Compared to the previous year, the event program in total was more profitable. Resulting from the above, are both the improved cash flow, now 11.6 Mill.

The growth in the full year is lower, because the figures of the two acquisitions of 2003 (Ned Air in May 03 and Möller Medical in August 03) are already included in the figures of the second half of the previous year.

The equity ratio rose to 33.4 % compared to 29.4 % at 31.12.2003 as, amongst other things, the bank debts were reduced further.

EUR7.4 million of this growth was accounted for by the French subgroup, BERU Eyquem, which is currently making only a negligible contribution to Group earnings. The Group\\'s Electronics and Sensor Technology division achieved the strongest organic growth with a plus of 30.4%, generating revenues of EUR21.0 million (EUR16.1 million). Earnings per share amounted to EUR0.77 compared with EUR0.64 for the same period of last year. For seasonal reasons, margins are always lower in the first quarter of the financial year; in the first quarter of 2004/05, BERU achieved an EBIT margin of 13.8% (14.0%), despite higher advance expenditure for new product startups and at Eyquem.

Before taxes, BERU earned 20.8% more, with EBT of EUR12.8 million compared with EUR10.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The total effective tax rate of 39.1% was a little higher (38.7%), due to the \"taxe professionelle\" at Eyquem, a tax on assets which is independent of earnings. The effective income-tax rate decreased by 2.0 percentage points to 36.1% (38.1%). Net income increased by 20.3% to EUR7.7 million (EUR6.4 million). First-quarter capital expenditure on tangible and intangible assets was higher than the annual average: at EUR9.3 million, it was also 55% higher than in the prior-year quarter. The Group demonstrated its financial strength with a 13.2% increase in cash flow to EUR13.7 million (EUR12.1 million).

In total Intertainment has been awarded 121.7 million dollars as a result of the lawsuit. This amount is made up of damages of 77.1 million dollars, punitive damages of 29 million dollars, and interest on the incurred damages of 15.6 million dollars. Prejudgement interest was awarded to Intertainment by the judge as part of her decision on the last remaining pending motions relating to the lawsuit. A jury in Santa Ana (Los Angeles) had already in June find all the parties liable sued by Intertainment in the lawsuit, and awarded the company compensatory damages and punitive dam-ages. As part of the judgment now issued, the judge also made it clear that all the defendants in the lawsuit are jointly and severally liable for the 77.1 million dollar damages amount. This joint and several liability also applies to the 15.6 million dollars of interest now awarded. The total amount for which they are jointly and severally liable is therefore 92.7 million dollars. The convicted parties include, in addition to Franchise Pictures and numerous subsidiary companies, Elie Samaha, the CEO of Franchise Pictures. Samaha is therefore held personally liable for both the compensatory damages and the prejudgment interest. A detailed breakdown of the punitive damages was given by the jury in its June decision. Of the punitive damages, Elie Samaha will have to pay 4 million dollars, Franchise Pictures, 1 million dollars, and Franchise\\'s 16 subsidiary companies, 1.5 million dollars each. Intertainment\\'s motion with the court to directly award , on the basis of a constructive trust, the rights and proceeds relating to the contested films for which a deposit had been paid and which were never received for commercial exploitation by Intertainment, was not granted by the judge. The judge also rejected Franchise Pictures\\' claims for an accounting on additional license fees resulting from the exploitation of films received prior to the lawsuit and in the meantime commercially exploited. These films include, for example, \"The Whole Nine Yards\" and \"Art of War\".

CEO Prof Wittig said: \"We had to solve the key question of modern biotech companies: How to get innovative biomedical drugs to the market, which may take six to twelve years of high-risk development, being financed through financial markets thinking in two year or even shorter cycles? By closing this deal with Arabian partners, to establish Arabian Centers for Cell- and Gene Therapy, we not only will substantially improve the financial situation of MOLOGEN short- and long-term, but also found a strategy to get our world-wide highly valued technologies to the pharmaceutical markets. Today, MOLOGEN provides the proof-of-principle that a focused technology development at a minimal burn rate works successfully. This contract will generate an enormous business impact for MOLOGEN.\" General information about MOLOGEN MOLOGEN focuses on its proprietary DNA technologies to create and develop treatments for high-unmet-need illnesses. The main focus are the unique and patented MIDGE and dSLIM technologies. Based on these platforms, MOLOGEN is developing DNA-based vaccines and therapeutics to prevent or cure a wide range of diseases. For its cell-based cancer therapies, MOLOGEN applies gene-modified and immunomodulated tumor cells having their origin in tumors from patients. Tumor cells were subsequently cultivated and established as cell lines. MIDGE DNA constructs and the also DNA-based molecules are then used to modify these cell lines in culture (ex-vivo). Thereby, therapeutic vaccines are produced for the treatment of metastatic states of various cancers. Going public in 1998, MOLOGEN was one of the first German biotechnology companies to be floated on the stock exchange. The MOLOGEN shares are traded on the Geregelter Markt in Frankfurt.

The deal was backdated to take economic effect from 30 June 2004. Within the framework of the refinancing of net AG, the assumed credits initially receive a three-year maturity, and the interest payable on the credits is more than halved. Furthermore, the termination of the bank pool financing for net AG is associated with further cost reductions. Part of the liabilities assumed by the investment group (EUR1.0 million) are structured as convertible bonds (the rights issue of the old holder having been excluded), whose conditions are modelled based on the decisions taken at the last Annual General Meeting of net AG held on 24 March 2004. Furthermore, part of the refinancing is the conversion of existing bearer bonds worth EUR0.5 million into equity capital. At the same time, the investment group will be involved in the recapitalisation of net mobile AG, a subsidiary of net AG, in order to thereby finance the further growth of net mobile AG. The transaction was structured and advised by Hock Finance, Munich. \"net AG is now solidly financed and can look towards the future with optimism\", said Dr. Stefan Immes, CEO at net AG. \"net AG now has planning security on the debt capital side, and we can now concentrate on the further positive development of the company.

However, the results for 2003 included an interim payment for a major project which alone amounted to EUR 1.3 million. Without this payment the revenues were comparable in both quarters. The costs of IVU were considerably lower in a year-on-year comparison: personnel costs alone were down EUR 2.6 million or 24 percent for Q1 and Q2 2004 on the figures for 2003. As a result of this, the EBIT improved by 44 percent to EUR (2.6) million, and the consolidated losses by 40 percent to EUR (2.9) million. The first quarter figures do not yet provide a basis for predictions about the overall performance for the financial year, because IVU traditionally generate up to half our revenue in the last quarter. In the first six months IVU has generated about 26 percent of the for 2004 expected revenues. \"I am optimistic that we will reach our goals this year - operating in the black again regarding EBTDA\", assured Prof. Dr. Ernst Denert, the Chairman of the Management Board of IVU.\" This is due to the many opportunities that the market currently provides us with. \"In addition figures for the first six months show that IVU\\'s restructuring measures introduced a year ago have begun to take effect.\" IVU has no longer activated performances in first six months 2004 from the development of software, in contrast to 2003, when more than EUR 0.5 million was activated. In past years, there were high-levels of activated performances, in particular for the development of the software platform for public transport. But these investments are beginning to pay off, and the systems are successful on the market. However, the sums left to be written off are still impacting on the results. IVU is the only system developer currently able to offer its customers an IT platform of software and hardware solutions for all public transport requirements. IVU\\'s systems are used by more than 300 transport utilities world-wide. Once again in the first quarter, IVU was able to win numerous new customers.

These sales were primarily generated by consultancy projects in the company\\'s focus sectors: industrial companies, automotive suppliers, the consumer goods industry, and the commerce sector. The consolidated results for the period under review totaled minus EUR 67,000 (previous year: EUR 588,000). With 9.1 million subscribed shares, this result corresponds to a loss per share of minus EUR 0.007 (previous year: EUR 0.065). The operating result (EBIT) for the first six months totaled minus EUR 95,000 (previous year: EUR 228,000). This result is also due to project delays and postponements on the part of clients. However, ORBIS adheres to its professed goal of \"positive annual results.\" This equity ratio increased to 58.3 % compared with the same period of the previous year (52.4 % as of June 30, 2003). During the reporting period, shareholders\\' equity totaled EUR 16.130 million (December 31, 2003: EUR 16.206 million). The scheduled repayments of long-term loans and the investments resulted in a EUR 1.287 million reduction in cash and cash equivalents during the first six months of 2004, compared with the annual financial statements for 2003. The cash flow from operating activities amounted to minus EUR 1.268 million (previous year: EUR 17,000), resulting largely from the establishment of a trade accounts receivable portfolio. As of the reporting date June 30, 2004, the ORBIS Group already boasts an order level that is equivalent to 79 % of the planned total annual sales for 2004. The changes in cost structures and the high level of cost-consciousness have resulted in significant savings. As a share of all sales revenue, a personnel expense ratio of 66.9 % was achieved for the first six months of 2004 (previous year: 67.7 %). As of the reporting date June 30, 2004, ORBIS employed 192 staff. With other operating expenses amounting to EUR 2.605 million, savings to the tune of 21.5 % over the same period 2003 were in fact realized.

The reason for this adjustment is a change in the situation that the Board faces. Contrary to Management expectations, underutilization of capacity in the important business segments assembly and microassembly technology and photovoltaics will continue until the end of August because the robotics and automation industry has fared worse in recent months than the economy overall, with the result that the order shortfall in the first half can no longer be made good in the second half of 2004.

EUR Employees 118 145 Order intake and turnover have clearly increased compared to the very weak first half of the previous year. The business in Germany and Europe has developed well based on projects in fine chemical and in general industrial applications which could partly compensate the continuing noticeable retention in capital expenditures of the pharmaceutical industry. The initiated short-term plan to reduce costs and to consolidate the corporation has already shown effective results. In particular the decisions taken in spring 2004 to reduce labour costs and the additional cutting of 31 jobs in the factory Bietigheim-Bissingen will lead to significant cost savings which however will have an effect during the second half of 2004 for the most part. As expected an operational loss of approx. 1,1 Mio. EUR still added up by 30.06.2004 - which yet could be reduced significantly compared to the first half of the previous year and the end of 2003 respectively. A stipulated outside financing in association with the implementation of capital measures respolved at the Annual Shareholders Meeting on the 27th May 2004 puts the financing of the HEINKEL AG on a firm basis again. An approved capital reduction at a ratio of 5:1 by merging five old shares to one new share will at first reduce the capital stock to 1.250.000 EUR. The following increase in capital stock by 2.500.000 EUR to a total capital stock of 3.750.000 EUR will result in a significant financial strengthening of the corporation's equity. The increase of the capital stock will be car-ried out by issuing 2.500.000 new shares with an issue price of 1,00 EUR per share. These new shares will be offered to the shareholders at a ratio of 1:2. The long-term Chinese sales partner of the HEINKEL AG, the Beijing Tianli Cryogenic Process Equipment Co. Ltd. (TINALI Technology) located in Beijing, has committed to subbscribe 1.443.250 new shares of the capital increase. The required rights to subscribe those new shares will be exclusively transferred by the CIK Vermögensverwaltung free of charge. In the meantime the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht - BaFin) has released the investor from the obligation to announce take over of control and to make an obligatory offer to all shareholders in accordance with section 35 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz - WpÜG) in case that control of the HEINKEL AG will be obtained. The Management of the HEINKEL AG has also committed to subscribe totally 200.000 new shares of the capital increase provided that the right to subscribe those new shares will be assigned free of charge or provided that non-subscribed shares will remain at the end of the purchase offer period. HEINKEL AG has appointed the VEM Aktienbank AG in Munich to implement the approved capital measures. The publication of the reference bid with a purchase offer period of 2 weeks is planned for September 2004. The Executive Board of the HEINKEL AG is asking all shareholders to support the adopted strategy to restructure the company and to participate in the capital increase. The further business development in 2004 is difficult to predict in the light of the uncertain progression of the world economy and the further continuing existing global overcapacities in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients. A pronounced pick-up of investment activities in this very important market segment of HEINKEL is not expected to take place before mid of 2005. The new strategic positioning of HEINKEL has well progressed. The broadened range of products and services offers new fields of application and therefore further growth potential. In the future HEINKEL will take advantage of an advanced global sales and service network - and in particular of intensified sales activities in China together with our sales partner TIANLI TECHNOLOGY. At present day's view the chances outbalance the risks. Various projects are developed to an advanced stage and are expected to be decided within the following months.

From the middle of the third quarter on, CeWe Color will be able to markedly increase volumes and sales due to plant closures among their competitors. Earnings burdened by restructuring measures CeWe Color achieved profits before tax (EBT) of Euro 1.1 million for the second quarter of 2004 (previous year: Euro 8.1 million), profits after tax of Euro -1.7 million (previous year: Euro 6 million) and cash flow totalling Euro 8.1 million (previous year: Euro 15.2 million). There are three essential reasons for the second-quarter drop in profits: - The currently weak market resulted in a decline in sales of 4.1 % in the second quarter 2004. - Prices for prints and profit margins are too low and must be increased. - Restructuring measures reduced earnings by Euro 4.3 million. Profit targets for 2004 within those so far declared The third and the fourth quarters will be far better than the first two quarters.

Slight losses in Germany could again be compensated and improved by increased sales within the EU to the USA and ASIA. The sales of the linoleum, PVC und textile product groups are about 5.7 % higher than in the preceding year. Results of operation In the first half year the Armstrong DLW Group had an annual loss of EUR 6.4M (loss in previous year: EUR 6.4M) and the result before tax amounted to EUR -5.9M (previous year: EUR -9.7M). The operation result at the end of the first half year 2004 was EUR -2.0M (previous year: EUR -5.4M). Armstrong DLW AG reports an annual loss of EUR 0.04 M in the first half year 2004, this is distinctly below the value of the previous year (previous year: EUR 1.2M) and reached a pre-tax profit amounting to EUR 0.1M (previous year: EUR 1.1M). The operation result at the end of the first half year 2004 showed a profit amounting to EUR 1.9M (previous year : EUR 1.7M). Orders received and orders on hand Orders received with the Armstrong DLW Group amounted to EUR 203.2M (previous year: EUR 185.8M). This corresponds to a rise of 9.4 % (previous year: decline of 31.3 % versus 2002). The orders on hand amounting to EUR 41.6M are by 3.7 % below the comparable value of EUR 43.2M in the preceding year. Armstrong DLW AG received orders in the amount of EUR 82.1M , which corresponds to a 19.9 % increase compared to the figure of EUR 68.5 M in the previous year. They have orders on hand in the amount of EUR 15.6M this means by 6.1 % more than in the preceding year, when the orders on hand amounted to EUR 14.7M. Investments and financing In the first six months of 2004 the Armstrong DLW Group realized investments of EUR 2.3M (preceding year: EUR 3.9M). Armstrong DLW AG invested EUR 0.8 M (previous year: EUR 1.6M). Employees On June 30, 2004 the Armstrong DLW Group had 2.414 employees (preceding year: 2.517). This change is mainly due to the closure of the plant in Oss, Netherlands and the integration of the sales force. On June 30, 2004 Armstrong DLW AG counted a total number of 1.133 employees (preceding year: 1.100). Outlook The strengthening and extension of our market position aiming at a market leadership in the commercial flooring business in Europe, and a perceptible improvement of our return on investment are supported by specific measures like reduction of capital accumulation in stocks and non-operation-necessary assets, country-specific plans to raise sales in the most important product groups, and cost reduction. We believe that this will help improve continuously the operating result of both Armstrong DLW AG and the Armstrong DLW Group. However, the result before tax will be charged by the introduction of the said measures. end of ad-hoc-announcement (c)DGAP 24.08.2004',\n",

The half-year figures also document the company's positive business performance. These first six months of 2004 saw sales of 32,814 TEUR (previous year: 30,235 TEUR), earnings before interest and taxes of 1,598 TEUR (previous year 1,350 TEUR) and a mid-year net profit of 615 TEUR (previous year: 88 TEUR). The three logistics projects acquired in the first half of the year were started on schedule with the assumption of operational-logistics responsibility as of 1 July 2004. This means that organic growth will continue in the latter half of the year. Experience shows that the second half is weaker in terms of sales and earnings than the first six months. In light of this, the corporate group, which for the first time had a staffing strength of more than 1,000 people in July, expects no change in its annual sales of EUR 68 million and foresees no significant contribution to earnings in the second half of 2004.

Mid-year loss per share of 15 euro cents (prior year: plus 26 euro cents) includes major value adjustments on income tax assets. Robust balance sheet with 63% shareholders' equity. Promising signals from a broadened range of products and services and increased sales operations with partners. Important new client contracts. Stuttgart, 25 August 2004 - As an IT service provider focused on IT Outsourcing, Human Resource Services and SAP Consulting, AC-Service finished the first half of the 2004 year with revenues of EUR 22.6 million (prior year: EUR 25.1 million) and an EBIT of EUR 0.5 million (prior year: EUR 1.9 million) after regular goodwill amortisation totalling EUR 0.4 million (prior year: EUR 0.4 million). The company posted a half-year loss after taxes and minority interests of EUR -0.8 million (prior year: EUR 1.4 million), which equates to a loss per share (IFRS) of 15 euro cents (prior year: plus 26 euro cents), after considerable special non-cash charges from accounting additions to value adjustments on income tax assets in the second quarter of 2004. The average staffing strength (FTEs) during the first six months of 2004 was 297 people (prior year: 323). The second quarter of 2004 saw sales of EUR 10.9 million (prior year: EUR 11.8 million), an EBIT of EUR 0.2 million (prior year: EUR 0.9 million) and an after-tax loss of EUR -0.7 million (prior year: EUR 0.8 million). The corresponding results for the previous year include one-time income items from investment tax credits and currency-exchange gains totalling about EUR 0.6 million. Cash flows from operating activities at mid-year 2004 paralleled earnings performance and declined to EUR 0.5 million from EUR 2.3 million last year, while the EUR 1.5 million used in investing activities stayed at about the same level as during the first half of 2003. Dividend distributions in the amount of some EUR 1.0 million (prior year: none) were also a factor in the decline in cash and cash equivalents from EUR 12.5 million as at 30 June 2003 to EUR 10.7 million as at 30 June 2004. AC-Service has a strong and healthy balance sheet. The shareholders' equity of EUR 25.0 million (31 Dec 03: EUR 26.4 million) accounts for 63% (31 Dec 03: 62%) of the balance sheet total of EUR 39.8 million (31 Dec 03: EUR 42.8 million). Contrary to expectations, the economic situation has remained difficult so far this third quarter of 2004 and is overshadowing the promising impulses and gains AC-Service has made with new clients, its expanded products and services portfolio, aggressive sales activities and a broadened partner network. It was on this basis that significant new customer contracts were made both in the area of SAP-based outsourcing and consulting services and in the Human Resource Services division under the ACCURAT brand, all of which merely helped dampen the decline in sales and earnings. In the financial year 2003 AC-Service posted consolidated sales of EUR 48.3 million, an EBIT of EUR 1.3 million and earnings per share of 21 euro cents. The Board of Directors expects a positive EBIT for the full 2004 year that, like sales, may lie below the results of the full 2003 year. The lean and highly cost- efficient organisation has been improved even further.

The healthy sales performance in the cartonboard area has been achieved both in Europe and on the non-European export markets, especially in Asia. Increasing price pressure was successfully countered by cost reduction measures. The folding carton area benefited from market success and the recent acquisitions. However, uncertainty remains about a sustained upturn in consumer demand in our main market of Western Europe. Outlook: At the beginning of the third quarter of 2004, order intake remained at a high level in all Divisions. Despite the improved industrial climate, demand for cartonboard and folding cartons still lacks impulses from the private consumer sector on the main market of Western Europe. Competition is therefore expected to remain strong. Consequently, cost reductions and efficiency increases are still decisive factors and will continue to be pursued with the highest priority, even if an increase in European sales prices is envisaged as a result of the rise in input prices. This year's acquisitions are expected to further contribute to the Company's growth during the second half of the year. Expansion will be continued in all Divisions.

In the first three quarters of the current fiscal year (October 1, 2003 - June 30, 2004) the positive trend in Nordex AG's new business stabilized further. Order receipts increased by 43 percent to EUR 169 mn year on year (previous year: EUR 118 mn). Here Nordex has grown above all in international terms. Today some 60 percent of new orders come from abroad (previous year: 30%) The trend towards large turbines is also continuing. Almost two thirds of new business is accounted for the new Nordex N80/N90 series. In spite of the larger order intake, at approx. EUR 156 mn revenues were 16 percent down on the previous year (EUR 186 mn). The main reasons for this development are longer lead times due to the increased international business and the higher amount of big turbines. In addition to this, since July 2003 Nordex only reports a major part of the project revenues after the turbines have been installed in the wind farm. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003/2004 too, earnings were above projections. After nine months the loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) came to EUR 19.4 mn (previous year: EUR 48.9 mn), equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of losses of around 60 percent. This improvement in earnings can be attributed above all to the drop in the cost-of-materials ratio from 90 to 79 percent. Nordex succeeded in cutting personnel expenditure by 17 percent to EUR 26.1 mn (previous year EUR 31.4 mn), net other operating expenses and income by as much as 42 percent to EUR 16.7 mn (previous year: EUR 28.6 mn). These cost reductions are the result of an extensive restructuring program that the Group has been implementing since July 2003. The overall target is to achieve an improvement in earnings of EUR 72.5 mn in 2005. To date Nordex has implemented some 74 percent of these measures and the program is going to be completed by the end of the year. As a result of high payments for preliminary work on new projects in the past quarter, liquidity is more or less balanced in the current financial year. Free cash flow was minus EUR 0.9 mn (previous year: minus EUR 93.7 mn). This can be attributed principally to the company's strict working capital management, according to which the production of orders is not commenced until shortly before the installation date. A further prerequisite is the receipt of a deposit of around 20 percent. However, the need to place orders for ongoing projects resulted in the expected utilization of liquidity in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year Nordex will not be able to fully compensate for the drop in revenues resulting from the strict working capital management. For this reason the company is reducing its revenue projection for fiscal 2003/2004 to EUR 205 mn. Due to the better-than-planned progress made in restructuring in the current fiscal year, Nordex is also reaffirming its earnings forecast of minus EUR 28 mn in spite of a lower volume of business. Nordex plans to return to profit territory in the course of fiscal 2005.

       " 'Neue Sentimental Film AG attains operational profit again / positive EBITDA and EBIT Frankfurt am Main, August 26th, 2004 - The Neue Sentimental Film AG announces figures for the first six months of the 2004 fiscal year. The Neue Sentimental Film Group achieved a turnover of EUR 6 million in the second quarter of 2004. Despite a still remaining weak business situation the company hits the forecast planning of EUR 12 million for the preceding mid-year. As compared to the adjusted results of the same period in the previous year the group raised its turnover by 6 %. The successfully completed restructuring measures affected the business development in former times than expected. Therefore NSF was able to reach a positive EBITDA of EUR 149 thousand (previous year: EUR -335 thousand) and even a positive EBIT of EUR 30 thousand (previous year: EUR -445 thousand) in the second quarter of 2004. These figures already show that in the fiscal year 2004 the group will once again be able to realize a balanced operating profit, due to the fact that as a result of the seasonal nature of advertising film production the first half of the fiscal year is significantly weaker than the second. This is planned for the EBITDA, but could now be reached for the EBIT as well. Therefore the company shows a successful return in the black again',\n",
       " 'EM.TV achieves clearly positive group results in the 1st half of 2004 Unterföhring, August 26, 2004 - The EM.TV group closed the first half of 2004 with clearly positive results irrespective of the substantial restructuring gain made in the first quarter. Sales essentially developed according to plan amounting to EUR106.6 mn in the first six months. The Sports segment accounted for EUR91.4 mn (86%) and the Entertainment segment (children and youth programs) for EUR15.2 mn (14%). Group sales of the former EM.TV & Merchandising AG amounted to EUR104.6 mn in the same period of the previous year; the comparability, however, is restricted due to the radical portfolio changes. At EUR59.0 mn, income in the second quarter of 2004 was significantly higher than in the first quarter (+24%), inter alia on account of the increased dynamism in the Sports segment, together with the sale of program rights as part of the extension of activities by the Spanish joint venture company Planeta Junior S.L. to Italy. Consolidated earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to EUR56.5 mn in the first half of the year. The main influencing factor in this respect was the second quarter income in the amount of EUR48.2 mn arising from the agreement with Kirch Media GmbH & Co. KGaA in liquidation regarding the acquisition of the remaining 50% holding in Junior.TV GmbH & Co. KG by EM.TV and the subsequent agreement and settlement of all rights and license matters between Kirch Media, Junior.TV and EM.TV, together with all mutual claims. Consolidated earnings before tax (EBT) amounted to EUR140.7 mn in the first six months. This includes a one-off gain of EUR94.4 mn arising from the restructuring of the 2000/2005 bond. After taxation and minority interests, the group shows a surplus of EUR135.8 mn after six months; it amounted to EUR41.4 mn after adjusting for the restructuring gain. The operating cash flow in the first half of the year amounted to EUR16.0 mn, the free cash flow reached 53.6 mn, mainly on account of the deconsolidation of the Tele München Gruppe. The group had liquid funds of EUR100.4 mn as at June 30, 2004 (equivalent to 25% of total assets). The equity ratio amounted to 38% and was therefore well above the level at March 31, 2004 (22%). The Management Board is anticipating consolidated sales of more than EUR200 mn in the whole year. Excluding the high restructuring gain from the first quarter, and assuming a positive business development, it is anticipating after-tax earnings in the medium double-digit million range for the full year.

       " 'Eurofins\\' Operating Margin Reaches almost 10% in the Second Quarter of 2004 Nantes/ Brussels, August 27, 2004 Over the last 4 years, Eurofins\\' EBIT*-margins continuously improved from 1.6% in Q2/ 2001 to 9.8% in Q2/ 2004. The efficiency programme, launched in Q2/ 2003, had a substantial positive effect on the profitability of the Eurofins Group during the first half-year of 2004. This is a particularly good performance, as traditionally most of the profits are generated during the second half of the year. EBITDA* grew by 46% to EUR 11.6 million in HY1/ 2004 compared to EUR 7.9 million in HY1/ 2003 (Q2/ 2004: EUR 6.7 million/ +38% vs. EUR 4.9 million in Q2/ 2003). At the same time, EBIT* improved by more than 100% to EUR 6.4 million (EUR 3.0 million in HY1/ 2003). Even after the costs of the efficiency programme, EBIT before goodwill is up by over EUR 2.5 million (+135%) EUR 4.6 million in the first half of this year as compared to the same period last year (Q2/ 2004: EUR 3.2 million/ +129% vs. EUR 1.4 million in Q2/ 2003). Net income according to IFRS amounted to EUR 1.7 million in HY1/ 2004 in comparison with EUR -0.4 million in HY1/ 2003 resulting in EPS of EUR 0.13 for the first six months of this year (Q2/ 2004: EUR 1.5 million/ +624% vs. EUR 0.2 million in Q2/ 2003). Cash flow from operating activities increased by more than 400% compared with the same period of last year to reach EUR 3.8 million in the first half-year of 2004 (EUR 0.7 million in HY1/ 2003). The gearing (financial debt net of cash/ equity) of 60% (63% at the end of Q1/ 2004), confirms Eurofins\\' sound financial structure, which leaves potential, when and if needed, to raise additional debt financing to fund further growth. In June 2004, fully provisioned earn-outs representing an amount of about EUR 4.7 million in the balance sheet were contributed as new equity by the creation of 347,616 new shares with an emission price of EUR 13.55. As a result, Eurofins\\' equity (IFRS) now exceeds EUR 60 million. Overall, these positive results underline progress made so far. The management feels that the Group should thus soon be able to focus on faster growth. * According to IFRS before goodwill and costs related to the efficiency programme. The term \"costs related to the efficiency programme\" used in this document mainly includes: - staff contract termination indemnities; - part of salary during notice period; - site closing costs including environmental and exceptional depreciation of assets of sites closed; - other restructuring costs.

The EBITDA improved substantially by KEUR 462 from KEUR 276 (first half year 2003) to KEUR 738 in the second half year 2004. At the same time pre-tax net income also improved by KEUR 238, from a loss of KEUR 759 in the first half year 2003 to KEUR -521. Likewise the results after tax improved by KEUR 145 over the same period a year earlier from a loss of KEUR 869 to KEUR -724. Sales in the Healthcare Software Division amounted in the first six months of 2004 to KEUR 3,868 (first half year 2003: KEUR 3,460), which means that we have achieved approximately 12 percent growth. Sales in the Healthcare Service Division declined slightly in the first six months of 2004, by 4.5 percent, from KEUR 2,559 (first half year 2003) to KEUR 2,445. The cash flow from operating activity improved. In the first half year 2003 it was KEUR 270 and it now proved possible to generate KEUR 2,738. These numbers include the first-time consolidaton of micom GmbH, Munich, in the month of June. Due to the short consolidation period, however, consolidation effects have entered the sales and result to a very limited degree. The trend was also positive in the rate at which new orders came in from outside Germany. The foreign share of sales in the first six months of 2004 rose from 16 in the previous year to 23 percent. This development has been mainly influenced by our activities in European and Arabic countries. Nexus AG possesses a healthy balance sheet.

We get the likelihood for each sentence in the first test review, then convert to a probability over star ratings. Every sentence in the review is evaluated separately and the final star rating of the review is an average vote of all the sentences. This is all in the following handy wrapper.
